      "&gt;**1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.** The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.\n",

      "&gt;**3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.** When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V).5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.\n",

Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.** Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.\n",

      " 1. Start Small - Start with something you can do immediately and easily. When we start with small successes, we build momentum to gain more confidence in our abilities.\n",
      "2. Create a Compelling Vision - Use the power of your imagination. Create an image of yourself as the confident and self-assured person you aspire to become. \n",
      "3. Socialize - Get out of the house or setup a lunch date with a friend. Socializing with others will give us opportunities to connect with other people, and practice our communication and interpersonal skills. \n",
      "4. Do Something that Scares You - As with all skills, we get better with practice and repetition. The more often we proactively do things that scare us, the less scary these situations will seem, and eventually will be rid of that fear.\n",
      "5. Do Something You Are Good At - What are you especially good at or enjoy doing? Regularly doing things that you are good at reinforces your belief in your abilities and strengths. I (Tina) can be very efficient with completing errands or administrative work.\n",
      "6. Set Goals - According to a study done at Virginia Tech, 80% of Americans say they don’t have goals. And the people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetime as people who don’t.\n",
      "7. Help Others Feel Good About Themselves - Help somebody or teach them something. When you help other people feel better about themselves and like themselves more, it will make you feel good about yourself. \n",
      "8. Get Clarity on Life Areas - Get clarity on the life area that needs the most attention. Your self-esteem is the average of your self-concept in all the major areas of your life. Write down all the major categories of your life, e.g., health, relationships, finance, etc. \n",
      "9. Create a Plan - Having a goal alone won’t do much. Get clarity on your action items. One of the biggest reasons people get lazy is because they don’t have a plan to achieve their goals. \n",
      "10. Get Motivated - Read something inspirational, listen to something empowering, talk to someone who can uplift our spirits, who can motivate us to become a better person, to live more consciously, and to take proactive steps towards creating a better life for ourselves and our families.\n",
      "11. Get External Compliments - As funny as this point suggests, go find a friend or family member and ask them “What do you like about me?” “What are my strengths?” or “What do you love about me?” We will often value other people’s opinions more than our own.\n",
      "12. Affirmations &amp; Introspection - Use affirmations, but in the right way. Some people think that when they’re in a slump, using positive affirmations will help them get out of it. I love affirmations, but I’ve realized you have to use them in the right way. \n",
      "13. No More Comparisons - Stop comparing yourself to other people. Low-self esteem stems from the feeling of being inferior. For example, if you were the only person in the world, do you think you could have low-self esteem? Self-esteem only comes into the picture when there are other people around us and we perceive that we are inferior.  \n",

I have the Mr. pick me up at work and instead of going home we head right to the bar so I can grieve properly. We're drinking in the middle of the workday at this bar and there's hardly anyone else in there and we're making conversation with the bartender. I talked about shopping for a new jeep and Craigslist comes up. From here I mention this stranger's problem with the dog and how sad it is/I'd kill someone if they stole my dog/they must be crushed...etc. Well the bartender chimes in with, \"Is it a white husky? My neighbor at the apartment complex all of a sudden has this white husky that showed up out of thin air and to be honest my neighbors are kinda dicks so that sounds like something they'd do.\"\n",

      ">DEAR SIR, -- I am now to acknoledge the receipt of your favors of October the 4th, 8th, & 26th. In the last you apologise for your letters of introduction to Americans coming here. It is so far from needing apology on your part, that it calls for thanks on mine. I endeavor to show civilities to all the Americans who come here, & will give me opportunities of doing it: and it is a matter of comfort to know from a good quarter what they are, & how far I may go in my attentions to them. Can you send me Woodmason's bills for the two copying presses for the M. de la Fayette, & the M. de Chastellux? The latter makes one article in a considerable account, of old standing, and which I cannot present for want of this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "> -- I do not know whether it is to yourself or Mr. Adams I am to give my thanks for the copy of the new constitution. I beg leave through you to place them where due. It will be yet three weeks before I shall receive them from America. There are very good articles in it: & very bad. I do not know which preponderate. What we have lately read in the history of Holland, in the chapter on the Stadtholder, would have sufficed to set me against a chief magistrate eligible for a long duration, if I had ever been disposed towards one: & what we have always read of the elections of Polish kings should have forever excluded the idea of one continuable for life. \n",
      "\n",
      ">Wonderful is the effect of impudent & persevering lying. The British ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat and model into every form lies about our being in anarchy, that the world has at length believed them, the English nation has believed them, the ministers themselves have come to believe them, & what is more wonderful, we have believed them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy exist? Where did it ever exist, except in the single instance of Massachusetts? And can history produce an instance of rebellion so honourably conducted? I say nothing of it's motives. They were founded in ignorance, not wickedness. \n",
      "\n",
      ">God forbid we should ever be 20 years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, & always well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13. states independent 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century & a half for each state. What country before ever existed a century & a half without a rebellion? & what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon & pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants. It is it's natural manure.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Our Convention has been too much impressed by the insurrection of Massachusetts: and in the spur of the moment they are setting up a kite to keep the hen-yard in order. I hope in God this article will be rectified before the new constitution is accepted. -- You ask me if any thing transpires here on the subject of S. America? Not a word. I know that there are combustible materials there, and that they wait the torch only. But this country probably will join the extinguishers. -- The want of facts worth communicating to you has occasioned me to give a little loose to dissertation. We must be contented to amuse, when we cannot inform.\n",

An officer could have gone over and spoken with the man, or given him a ticket for a disturbance of the peace after he exited his vehicle. Obstruction of justice is a bit far. It is possible he could be detained from that perspective and given a ticket. Handcuffing in this situation is a possible violation of his miranda rights and an escalation into arrest. Quite a jump if the man wasn't going to comply. In the end he showed no issues complying, which isn't a surprise given that he could have been seen as provoking hem. It is just as possible that his intent was provoking the officers into arresting him (which would still have been incorrect for the officer's to immediately arrest him). That will be up to witness statements and the accounts from both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same thing will end up being determining factors on whether this was an arrest or detainment. He was handcuffed. He was brought into custody. But was this arrest? Probably. That is what seems to be the general consensus among the media anyways. Take it with a grain of salt, but he was at the very least taken into custody and detained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was the intent to provoke? That isn't able to be determined from the video itself due to the conversations being muffled or outright unknown. However, it is pretty stupid to heckle officers in the middle of a raid. A tense situation, and yelling back at officers. Not good.\n",

He could have feared for his own safety, and given the racial trends with cops currently and over-extension of power this is certainly possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even worse, it was a high profile situation where the arrest was made with bystanders recording everything. The officers should have double checked to make sure the dog given it's breed was secured, and the arrest was made far too quickly when matters should have been discussed with the individual on a one-on-one basis to minimize media fallout (especially given how it was an extremely fast reading of the miranda rights if the charges aren't a misdemeanor and he was interrogated on the spot, which isn't likely either way; an interrogation wouldn't serve the officers at this point if the arrest was made for impeding an investigation, vehicle violation, or other charges). \n",

      "California state law is super-ceded in this case by the Supreme Court's ruling from 2012. The man had a right to be where he was given that it was beyond the officer's cars and the area wasn't properly cordoned off. A verbal warning should have been given to back off if the officer's felt it was needed. Again this will be found out in witness statements with the impending investigation on the horizon.\n",
      "If he was directed to do so and disobeyed, then the officers are correct in arresting him. But not if it was because he was filming. That's a dead horse that has been beaten into the ground, even if officers still forget or ignore the ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of what the man said to the officers it is easily thrown out in court, the excuse of impeding an investigation is a relatively moot point given that the area wasn't even properly cordoned off. If the officers required that loud music or disturbances were removed further then the traffic-way should have been blocked off and bystanders removed from the area. Why was it only half a block in area and no officers, just vehicles used to cordon the area? Especially for an armed robbery? It probably should have been a larger area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that the officer discharged a weapon against a potential threat with a large amount of bystanders nearby is what should scare people. A ricochet or complete penetration could have occurred in this instance with a great risk to innocent bystanders (not even the man who was arrested) when alternative methods could have been utilized. Officer's are too quick to rely on their guns instead of their brains sometimes. Justifiably so in many cases, but not more so here.\n",

      "My first daughter was born with Polands. She is almost 7 now. When she came out and the dr. threw her on my ex wifes chest, her hand smacked my wife right in the face. Thats when we noticed it was smaller and all the fingers were webbed, like one big finger. We said whats that, the nurse said \"oh looks like shes got a little something going on\". And right then my mother in law burst into the room all happy and shouts \"let me see those ten little fingers and ten little toes\". This all happened in about 1 minute. The good natured comment from the mother in law and what it must have felt like when she realized what we said in response was pretty distracting from the situation.\n",

      "After going through the major tests for problems with organs and heart we were able to go home. We had an appointment at childrens hospital a few days later. They told us all they could find was the hand deformity and that she was missing her right pectoral major muscle.\n",
      " In her hand she had all the bones, but she had no joints in her fingers, just her thumb. And the skin and muscle was all fused as one peice of flesh, like the palm of a hand. The small hand is about half the size of the other. \n",
      "After a few more appointments they scheduled her first surgery. At 6 months old they seperated her thumb and pinky. She had her 5th and last surgery for now when she was 4. She now has 5 fingers that bend at the palm, all 5 nails, and can use it without much difficulty. Still no joints in the fingers so grabbing large or round objects can be hard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each surgery was very scary for us. Not for her. She had trouble waking up once. \n",
      "About 2 weeks after her last surgery, she got a sliver in her toe from a picnic table at a beach. From it a month later she had a staff/strep infection in her blood and heart which damaged a valve. This caused juvanile rhymatoid arthritous. She had to be on steroids and all sorts of stuff a couple times daily. They wanted to amputate her leg at one time. Luckily it has been knocked down enough that she has no problems from it besides sore joints occationaly. But she will have complications for ever. She does have strength issues with her arm and chest, cant do a pushup. She is smart, active in sports and dance, well off socially, and seems to always be the \"alpha\" in her groups.\n",

      "So after all those shannanigans in her early life, what scares me shitless and the most out of any of it is that her right chest is litterally sunk in and her mom had large breasts early in life. She handles people saying things about her hand just fine. Even when other kids pick on her. But I am petrified that as she gets older being made fun of will alter her personallity and take away all that she is now. I have accepted that in 10 years im going to go to jail for punching the shit out of some punk kid that breaks her soul.\n",

      "I find it very shocking, frightful, and disturbing that the US Customs would have any access to Canadian     citizens medical history. Nonetheless, US Customs does indeed have access to Canadian confidential medical     records as cited [here]    (http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/11/28/disabled_woman_denied_entry_to_us_after_agent_cites_supposedly_private_medical_details.html) in this article written by the Toronto Star. \n",

      "I ask that you please review Canadian privacy acts related to confidentiality of medical information and create or rewrite/amend any legislation relating to Canadian citizen's privacy so that Canadian citizens' medical history would not be given to US Customs or any foreign agency or government under any circumstances without personal authorization and consent. Likewise, it should be mandatory that if authorization forms are presented, the language of the form would be blatantly and abundantly clear and written in a way that would make it obvious to the person authorizing the intention of this type of form or document. Moreover, such authorization should be able to be easily revoked at any time. If such legislation already exists, I ask that you strongly reinforce this policy through your legal agencies to ensure such information is not released again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is absolutely no excuse and no good reason for releasing medical information to any foreign agency, especially when such information is abused like this. Releasing medical information sends the implicit message that those who seek medical help, in this case psychiatric help, are at risk of losing dignity and privacy, ultimately turning people away from seeking help. Those who require psychiatric help are vulnerable and require confidence in our medical system and its privacy in order to treat them, not turn them away through fear of lack of confidentiality. \n",

      "I know I'm a little late to the party, but I'm still going to cite some case law to put the legality of this into perspective.  As far as I'm aware (and I'm no expert) the closest and most recent US Supreme Court case to this particular type of surveillance is U.S. v. Jones (2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "A brief summary from wikipedia:  Police investigators asked for and received a warrant to attach a GPS tracking device to the underside of the defendant's car but then exceeded the warrant's scope in both geography and length of time. The Supreme Court justices voted unanimously that this violated the Fourth Amendment, though they were split on the reasoning. The majority held that by installing the GPS device on the defendants car the police had committed a trespass on private property and that the trespass constituted an unreasonable search per se.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference in reasoning is very important to this news because the 5 justices agreeing in reasoning felt that they did not need to rule on whether tracking the location over extended periods of time violated the unreasonable expectation of privacy test.  Rather, they opined that the physical act of putting the GPS devise on the suspects cars was a trespass by the police, and that this fact alone was all that was needed to rule that the police violated the 4th amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mind you, this was intentional.  They did not want to rule just yet on whether the collection of data through GPS location is unconstitutional without physically putting it there through trespass.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The four justices concurring with the outcome of the case (i.e., and not with Scalia's reasoning) argued that reliance on the common law property based analysis of a search should not have been used in this sort of highly technological case.  Alito argued that they should have decided this case using the reasonable expectation of privacy test, and that this surveillance would have failed that test.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be noted that Sotomayor, agreeing with Scalia's trespass reasoning, also wrote a concurrence in which she agreed that had the case needed to have been decided under the reasonable expectation of privacy test, she would have agreed with Alito and the three other justices concurring only in outcome that this surveillance would have failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "My take away from this:  The SCOTUS had the opportunity to declare the type of surveillance the NSA is engaging in unconstitutional only a year ago, but they balked.  However, if this lineup of justices stays the same of substantially similar, they will declare it unconstitutional.  Alito and the three justices agreeing with his concurrence will team up with Sotomayor to get to at least a majority of five.\n",

      "* **screen, w3m, vim, ssh:**  First things I ensure are installed on pretty much any system.  These give terminal multiplexing (tmux is a newer option), a console-mode browser with vi-like keybindings, a real fucking editor, and remote access.  Even with just a console set up, these can solve many problems.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **[GNU units](/r/dredmorbius/comments/1x9u0f/gnu_units_utility_and_energy_resource_calculations/):**  While most people use it to just convert between, say, inches and centimeters, it can do far, far more.  I discovered its hidden power when starting to ask questions like \"how many square miles of solar PV arrays would it take to provide all of US energy needs\".  [It's also extensible](/r/dredmorbius/comments/1yvxde/how_many_hiroshima_bombs_in_a_ferrari_with/) -- you can define additional units of energy as needed.  Knows a ton of prefixes and textual numbers -- so if you want ouput in millions of acres, rather than scientific exponential notation, you can get that.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **script's timings option / scriptreplay**  The venerable `script` program will create a \"typescript\" file of your shell session.  Less well known is its timings option, which can save the timing data to a second file.  `scriptreplay` will play both of these back, with an optional time divisor option to speed things up a tad.\n",

      "* **awk:**  Hardly a secret, but a much-underappreciated tool that spans the space between gnarly bash scripts and perl's line noise.  It's also been optimized incredibly over nearly 40 years, and has pretty spectacular performace.  Not quite compiled-language speed, but not too far off, and, well, you don't need to compile.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **make:**  It's not just for compiling.  As a writer using various tools, make can be used to simplify the task of creating outputs from your source files.  This is covered in the O'Reilly book _UNIX Power Tools_ (Peek, Loukides, O'Reilly, et al), which is also a gem.\n",

His forecasts consist of saying the world is about to end, and then when anything bad happens, he claims he was right all along.

      "**Fnatic** - So far had a fairly easy run in Katowice, starting out and continuing to be the clear favorites to take home the title. Until today's map on cobblestone vs VP they had yet to be pushed to the very edge, and in the one time they did they prevailed with 3 strait T rounds in overtime to take the map against VP. They have had solid CT and T sides (excluding the CT mirage against VP) and all their players are playing at an extremely high level, particularly Olofmeister (aka tecmeister). Their best maps so far seem to be Inferno, Cobblestone, Cache and Mirage (Vetoing overpass and nuke depending on the opponent)\n",
      "\n",
      "**NiP** - The Ninja's have looked less convincing than Fnatic until their match today against the reigning champions EnVyUS who they took out of the competition in emphatic fashion with a 2-0 defeat which included a great T-half on cache. Overall NiP seems to be the team with the best grasp on T side play in the world ATM. However seemingly their CT side can be shaky at times, I theorize this may be down to communication flaws with the recent addition of Allu in the team but I don’t really know. Their best maps seem to be Dust2, Cache, Nuke and Mirage. Vetoing Overpass whenever possible and having a shocker of a match on Inferno against TSM starting CT side any losing 16-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dust 2** - Vetoed out by Fnatic. Seemingly NiP's strongest map since the addition of Allu with strong performances against TSM and EnVyUS (previously thought to be the best dust_2 team in the world before this event where they have dropped maps to Na'Vi and NiP). A map that Fnatic have been very mediocre on in the past. 65-35 NiP if not vetoed\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nuke** - Usually would be a veto from Fnatic however due to NiP's iffy performance of the map today and the fact that the team who picks the map will start on T side I doubt we will see Nuke unless it is the 3rd map in this BO3. Although Fnatic don’t practice the map they have surprisingly good results on the map with 3 wins in the last 3 games. A 16-14 vs VP in the \"King of Majors\" online tournament and a 16-7 win and 16-14 win against EnVyUS during IOS Pantamera. 60-40 NiP\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mirage** - Possible pick by either team. Fnatic have a much richer history on this map seeming as NiP never played the map during the time Fifflaren was on the team. However since DHW NiP have had good showings on the map including a dominating performance against CLG 16-7 during the group stage of this major (take from this as much as you like). I would see Fnatic picking this map being more likely than NiP due to their performance against VP in the semi-finals with a 16-8 win against the Poles on their home map on home soil. 60-40 Fnatic\n",
      "\n",
      "**Inferno** - I think NiP should Veto this map however I don't think they will, and this is what I think will cost them the major. NiP looked really poor VS TSM on inferno in the quarter final match on this map and with Fnatic being the best team in the world on inferno I dont think NiP has a very good chance of taking this one, even though historically NiP have been a strong inferno team. I think NiP may be in the unfortunate situation of having to ban out their weak maps rather than their opponents strongest map. 65-35 Fnatic\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cache** – A strong map for both teams and a map either team could pick due to Fnatic favouring the CT side and NiP favouring the T side making the side choice more of a place for mind tricks. This should be the most interesting map between the two teams to see which strength will be strongest, T side or CT side. Fnatic have only played 1 game on Cache so far and that was against Penta where they played very standard meaning that they will probably have more to scout on NiPs performance against EnVyUS than NiP can scout on them and can come into this map more prepared which will give them an advantage. 50-50\n",

They acquire a company that previously put out successful titles, put more and more pressure on it to perform to unrealistically high expectations all the while changing the game's core features and ideas away from what made that series great in the first place, then when the product is crap and doesn't sell as well as EA wants, they use that as a justification to shut the studio down and mothball the IP.

It also helps the passer lead you properly. Sometimes I will very deliberately and exaggeratedly present my stick where I want the puck.

A lot of things can go wrong here and glitchy audio running at a wrong sample rate could absolutely happen, or just good old human error.\n",
      "\n",
      "What i think happened is the following: Someone at Nvidia, Rocksteady or a third party used the \"benchmark\" command in Unreal Engine 3 along with the dumpmovie command in order to get a video that runs at a completely stable 60fps. The issue is that they then also recorded audio at the same time, resulting in them having to resample the audio incorrectly.\n",

      "Running unoptimized code could make it hard to produce a video that is indicative of the actual performance of any game, so it's not really false advertisement as people with good enough hardware can absolutely run the game at that quality level.

The audio however is played back at it's original pace, recording the video using dumpmovie while locked at 60 fps using the benchmark setting while externally recording the audio, does indeed produce a result similar to what is seen in the nVidia video.\n",

I hit the desk so hard my hand still hurt 10 minutes later, but the very next try was finally successful, gold medal even, and I also beat my buddy's best time as a bonus. the game's usually more forgiving than this (like in the other problematic race, even after a crash I could finish in 3rd or 4th place), but in some cases it can be really frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've completed all the cop events, got 28 golds out of 48 (mostly hot pursuits, which are the most fun, the rest is luck/random/glad to be over) and all 60 racer events (19 gold). the final race was 43.5 miles, which, compared to the longest events' 15 was quite a thing. I finished it under 15 minutes and got bronze, and of course crashed a few times, including once about 200 meters before the finish line while I was in 4th place. luckily #3 had crashed just before me and I hit him and got back into the race at #3, otherwise it would've been 4th place and I probably wouldn't have tried it again. the race started in the afternoon and turned into night while driving, but the most atmospheric thing was probably an earlier pursuit, which started in the evening in the sunshine, but when I came out of the tunnel after a few miles, it clouded over, there was thunder and lightning, it started to get darker and the cops showed up.\n",

      "I really wish there were another game like this. sure, I could re-do the events for better results or just cruise the courses, but I want more of the almost-same. the gameplay is really fun, the game looks great, even some of the soundtrack's tolerable, so throwing in new environments and some new cars would be enough for me (a lot of cars are identical in this one, except for the paintjobs, which is weird because you can change the color anyway, so you basically unlock a new set of colors instead of new cars). I already played **test drive unlimited** (didn't bother finishing all the races there, it was way too difficult, but I did what I could), and I still have **tdu2**, **fuel** and **burnout paradise** to play (and maybe **most wanted 2012**, I hear it's very similar to burnout), but that's it, and probably none of these will offer the same kind of fun as nfs:hp did (I remember the cops in tdu being total dicks, towards the end I had to turn them off so I could complete a few more races).\n",

      "You’ve [said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8520033/Stephen-Hawking-tells-Google-philosophy-is-dead.html) that “philosophy is dead” and “philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics.” What led you to say this? There are many philosophers who have kept up with physics quite well, including [David Albert](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/david-z-albert), [Tim Maudlin](http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/timmaudlin.html), [Laura Ruetsche](https://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/ci.ruetschelaura_ci.detail), and [David Wallace](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert0130/), just to name a very few out of many. And philosophers have played (and still play) an active role in placing the many-worlds view of quantum physics — which you [support](https://books.google.com/books?id=z9jH9mYiO5IC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false) — on firm ground. Even well-respected physicists such as Sean Carroll have [said](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/23/physicists-should-stop-saying-silly-things-about-philosophy/) that “physicists should stop saying silly things about philosophy.” In light of all of this, why did you say that philosophy is dead and philosophers don’t know physics? And do you still think that’s the case?\n",

      "Allegations[edit]\n",
      "In June 2005, a story appeared in the San Diego Union Tribune by Marcus Stern and Jerry Kammer, who would later receive a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting. The story revealed that a defense contractor, Mitchell Wade, founder of the defense contracting firm MZM Inc. (since renamed Athena Innovative Solutions Inc.), bought Cunningham's house in Del Mar in 2003 for $1,675,000. A month later, Wade placed it back on the market where it remained unsold for 8 months until the price was reduced to $975,000. Cunningham was a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee at the time. Soon after the purchase, Wade's company began to receive tens of millions of dollars worth of defense and intelligence contracts. Cunningham claimed the deal was legitimate, adding, \"I feel very confident that I haven't done anything wrong.\"[22]\n",
      "Later in June, it was further reported that Cunningham lived rent-free on a yacht aptly named the \"Duke Stir\" while he was in Washington. The yacht was owned by Wade; Cunningham paid only for maintenance.[23] An article in The San Diego Union Tribune reported that Cunningham liked to invite women to his yacht. Two of them said that he would change into pajama bottoms and a turtleneck sweater to entertain them with chilled champagne by the light of his lava lamp.[24]\n",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation regarding the real estate transaction. His home, MZM corporate offices, and Wade's home were all simultaneously raided by several federal agencies with warrants on July 1, 2005.[25]\n",
      "On July 14, 2005 Cunningham announced he would not run for a ninth term in 2006, saying that while he believed he'd be cleared of any wrongdoing, he could not defend himself and run for reelection at the same time. He admitted to displaying \"poor judgment\" when he sold his house to Wade.[26]\n",
      "Besides Wade, the three other co-conspirators were: Brent R. Wilkes, founder of San Diego-based ADCS Inc.; New York businessman Thomas Kontogiannis; and John T. Michael, Kontogiannis' nephew and the owner of a New York-based mortgage company, Coastal Capital Corp. Property records show the company made $1.15 million in real estate loans to Cunningham, two of which were used in the purchase of his Rancho Santa Fe mansion. Court records show that Wade paid off one of those loans.[27]\n",
      "In 1997, Cunningham had pushed the Pentagon into buying a $20 million document-digitization system created by ADCS Inc., one of several defense companies owned by Wilkes. The Pentagon did not want to buy the system. When it had not done so three years later, Cunningham angrily demanded the firing of Lou Kratz, an assistant undersecretary of defense that Cunningham held responsible for the delays.[13] It later emerged that Wilkes reportedly gave Cunningham more than $630,000 in cash and favors.[28]\n",
      "Cunningham was also criticized for selling merchandise on his personal website,[29] such as a $595 Buck knife featuring the official Congressional seal.[30][31] He failed to obtain permission to use the seal, which is a federal offense.[32]\n",
      "On April 27, 2006, months after his guilty plea, The Wall Street Journal reported that, in addition to all the favors, gifts and money Cunningham received from defense contractors who wanted his help in obtaining contracts, Cunningham may have been provided with prostitutes, hotel rooms and limousines.[33]\n",

      "Plea agreement[edit]\n",
      "On November 28, 2005, Cunningham pleaded guilty to tax evasion, conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud in federal court in San Diego. Among the many bribes Cunningham admitted receiving were the house sale at an inflated price, the free use of the yacht, a used Rolls-Royce, antique furniture, Persian rugs, jewelry, and a $2,000 contribution for his daughter's college graduation party.[34] Cunningham's attorney, Mark Holscher, later said that the government's evidence was so overwhelming that he had no choice but to recommend a guilty plea.[35] With the plea bargain, Cunningham faced a maximum of 10 years; had he fought the charges, Cunningham risked spending the rest of his life in prison.\n",
      "As part of his guilty plea, Cunningham agreed to forfeit his $2.55 million home in Rancho Santa Fe, which he bought with the proceeds of the sale of the Del Mar house. Cunningham initially tried to sell the Rancho Santa Fe house, but federal prosecutors moved to block the sale after finding evidence it was purchased with Wade's money. (Wade, with others, even paid off the balance Cunningham owed on the mortgage.) Cunningham will also forfeit more than $1.8 million in cash, antiques, rugs, and other items.\n",
      "Also as part of the plea agreement, Cunningham agreed to help the government in its prosecution of others involved in the defense contractor bribery scandal.\n",

You smack a baseball back and forth, accelerating up to ludicrous speeds until someone gets hit. And I mean really ludicrous speeds, there's a dramatic pause when you hit the ball that gives the opponent time to predict which way you're aiming, get into position, and then time their swing for the frame the ball starts moving because eventually it can just instantly shoot all the way to the wall and then ricochet every frame. And like Smash, it's simple to pick up and play as a party game, with 4 player free for alls (teams too, I found 2v1 and 3v1 were good ways to make it fair introducing it to friends, and with fellow pros try 2v2) where you can laugh at the unbridled chaos of how fast that ball can get, but then take it to the next level with serious competitive depth once you learn how to keep up with light speed and beyond.\n",

      "I wrote a medium-length paper on DMCA takedown procedure last semester. The academics that have weighed in split on two fronts; the same two fronts that *all* of Copyright law balances. There are copyright *maximalists* that would value authors and their works above the public need for access. There are also copyright *minimalists* who challenge that the need for economic incentive of heavy copyright do not outweigh the value of public access and a broad public domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ultimately think the law on this issue yields three general conclusions. (1) Copyright owners cannot be expected to go one-by-one in issuing takedown notices. The internet is too vast, infringement is too easy, and fair use is too complicated for people like Prince to approach each and every instance with the legal and political analysis they would want. (2) End users *should* be allowed to use copyright-protected works in a way that the original idea of fair use was meant to protect. Commentary, criticism, transformation... these are all invaluable to the proper appreciation and value of artistic works. Thus a good copyright system has to ensure authors protection while still allowing for *some* unlicensed fair use. (3) ISPs are capable of monitoring their own services in a way that would alleviate much of the burden put on copyright owners in the current system. Companies like Google and Amazon are more than capable of using the same detection methods (Youtube ContentID for example) that owners are using right now to police infringement. But they aren't because when the DMCA was passed, Congress believed they *would not* be able to. But now that we have seen Google grow to the monolith that it is, it's about time we start holding ISPs accountable for their own products.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with Lenz. I think it's unfair for end users to bear the brunt of a bad system where takedowns without cause are left unchallenged. But this just shifts the burden over to the copyright owners, most of whom aren't as well off as Prince, Jay-Z, and other big name artists. For these owners, the methods of detection aren't as available or are prohibitively expensive. This is especially true for music publishers and publishing associations. Now is many years too late for us to start holding ISPs accountable for the activity of users that might infringe copyrights. The DMCA was enacted in a time when we weren't sure how successful ISPs could be without the safe harbor help. We know now.\n",

      "Due to extensive research done by the University of Pittsburgh, diamond has been confirmed as the hardest metal known to man. The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 9000 wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 9000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not the hardest metal known to man.\n",

      "I took the time to study Windows 10 very thoroughly before I installed it, and when I did I very heavily stripped down, modified and riced it to remove every single botnet/big brother aspect possible while configuring everything to my exact needs. I'm very happy with Windows 10, my idling wireshark, fiddler and peerblock logs are 100% clean of all personal/unknown information sent to microsoft servers or CDNs that W10 normally does and I haven't had any issues like OP period. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do think it's a shame, though, that every new Windows version it gets more difficult and time-consuming to saw through Microsoft's closed-source shell of integrated crapware to uncover and freely use the operating system long-time windows users want. With windows 7 it was essentially nothing more than a few settings. With windows 8, we began to rely on ricing by leaning more heavily on our favorite third-party operating system components such as classic shell and 3rd-party system tools and utilities. Now, with Windows 10, we have to do countless meticulous hours of editing registry values, forcing through multiple changes or deletions to the internal group policy and integrated services, use powershell to force the deletion of ridiculous numbers of bloatware apps, and spend more hours than ever configuring just basic settings like default programs, security, ui and shell behavior to the state equivalent to that we'd had on the previous version, not to mention that nowadays essentially every single hardware driver, hardware utility, graphical application, system tool, and basically every other application we use is by necessity third-party and must be installed and itself configured manually. Practically the only microsoft software I find myself running nowadays is Windows itself; many of the applications I use now are open-source and sometimes directly ported from Linux, and I usually use them because of the very high number of features and level of configurability and customizability they offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only worry that the day will come soon when even people who would know how if it were possible can no longer modify Windows to suit their needs. Even now, the closed source nature of Windows 10 prevents me from completely uninstalling many deeply integrated applications that I do not use, and I cannot install regular operating system updates from microsoft without first checking whether my data will be at risk on a test bench first, or else risk allowing Windows 10 to send personal information I have stored to microsoft.\n",

      "I've been a dedicated Windows user for many years, and I've always stuck with it during the toughest times like RTM Windows 8, RTM Windows Vista and, going back far enough, the first release of Windows 95. However, there are days when I realize that if Valve succeeds in their impossible quest to make Linux successful on the desktop, there is little keeping me from throwing away Windows entirely like some already have and using exclusively other operating systems. Linux's sole, most glaring, unavoidable problem is that, despite the many things it can do more efficiently than Windows, there are some things Windows can do very well that Linux physically *can't* do at all, for whichever of the many reasons that may be. Some of these things are hardware-specific, and some of them are software-specific or both, but the truth right now is that I won't be able to switch to using Linux on my primary workstations until Linux is at least able to utilize the full potential of all PC hardware to the degree that Windows can *and* is able to run any new application that might be released just was well as Windows can without any hard, unavoidable limitations.\n",

      "\n",
      "Edit: lengthly explanation time!  Some of you guys might recall from chemistry physics class, there is a simple relationship for calculating the energy in a wavelength, which is Energy= hc/lambda, where h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and lambda is the wavelength of your frequency.  Radio waves are *very* large on the electromagnetic spectrum's scale- when discussing visible light for example we discuss it in *nanometers*, but the most famous radio astronomy frequency (where we see the hydrogen line) is 21 *centimeters*, ie many many times longer.  So, for example, if you go to [this calculator](https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/cnvcalc.htm) and input the frequency I work at- 57 MHz- you will see you get about 2.4E-7 electron Volts per photon, and it's 2.6E22 eVs in one calorie.\n",

We learn a lot from it, but there just really isn't that much energy in it! (Which is why, btw, people listen for radio signals from aliens a la SETI- very low energy for a strong signal- but that's another story for another post!)\n",

I would creep on r/fallout and r/FO4 and read about what other people were dealing with the wait, and it helped a bit. Fast forward 'till release day, and I know the game runs poorly. It's optimized poorly, and has FPS drops on even the best cards on ultra. I have a 270X and I still buy the game, and it's among the best damn games I've ever played. I've done almost 200 hours of it, and I love it, but I run it with everything on medium/low, godrays off, I've done several of the game improvements in the .ini files and preferences files, and it still runs like shit on my PC. I knew it would, and I have accepted that, but to get this chance at getting a GTX 770? Getting this chance to run the game at high settings with a stable FPS?

      "Valve making a post explaining their position was a very good move and it does shed some light on their reasoning. Understanding what they're up against helps make the bitter pill of trade holds slightly easier to swallow. I'm also glad they eased restrictions between longtime friends a bit. This suggests that they truly ARE trying to listen to the community. *(I know that I mentioned both those moves in my [gigantic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/3vljb3/the_ramifications_of_valves_upcoming_trade_holds/) post on this issue a few days ago. No idea if my post and its comments were one of the ones they read, but the formatting on their responses looks and sounds enough like mine that I'm going to go eat a success cookie and ignore suggestions that most good formatting looks alike.

Higher settings or is the GTX970 already based on very high settings? In short, what level of performance does Oculus consider \"recommended\"? I don't want to spend €300 on a video card if €400 gets me a much better (and longer) experience.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- What about dead pixels? I can imagine that a dead pixel is not something you want in terms of immersion. Most display/tv manufactures allow for x amount of dead pixels. Will this level of acceptable dead pixels be limited to 0 on rifts? Will 1 dead pixel (in the visible field) be enough for a RMA and will the displays be checked before shipping?\n",

      "Awesome! Thought I'd take this opportunity to share my own story of PC gaming, and my builds through the ages. I first startet gaming on a PC way back in 2006/2007, mainly using emulators to play older games on my (not very impressive) laptop at the time. I also played a few MMOs, but nothing to 'hardcore'. My interest in the hardware itself, however, steadily grew, and as I learned more I became convinced that they way to go was to build my own desktop PC.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring of 2008 I finally built my first rig. I called her 'Icebear' (and I know that the actual animal is called a polar bear, I just liked it better). She consisted of a Core 2 Duo E4500, a passively cooled GeForce 8500 GT, and 2GB of DDR2 RAM, together with an older 1280x1024 17\" monitor and some random mouse/keyboard combo. I spent a couple of hours building her, and it was a beautiful experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the later years I upgraded her, a few parts at a time. My first major upgrade was changing the motherboard, CPU and GPU to a EVGA nForce 750i FTW (amazing motherboard at the time), a Core 2 Duo E8400, and a GeForce GTS 250 (512mb model). The next major upgrade was the monitor, when I got a 24\" 1080p TV in 2010, I think. Some years later I again upgraded the CPU and motherboard (and the ram), this time to a B75 motherboard, a Core i5 3470 and 8GB of DDR3. Then in early 2015 (yes, a year ago) I finally got an SSD, along with a new case (Corsair 300R), and finally a proper GPU upgrade - the GTX 970 from EVGA.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very happy with Icebear at this point, but then I got a new monitor - the Acer XB270HU. 1440p and 144hz proved too much for my dear Icebear, so I decided that it was time to say goodbye. I sold her, and used the money to buy a completely new rig this January. And she is absolutely fantastic - Core i5 6600k overclocked to 4,5ghz with the Noctua NH-D15 cooler, an Asus Z170-A motherboard, 250GB Samsung EVO SSD and a 2TB 7200rpm HDD, an EVGA 750 G2 PSU, and the EVGA GTX 980Ti SC+ GPU. All of this in the Fractal Design Define S (non-windowed), with 3 Noctua NF-A14s as intake fans. Yes, it's a air-cooling-monster. I call her Graviton, because that's the coolest (hypothetical) elementary particle, and because the CPU cooler is fucking massive.\n",

      "nan ... troll?: 0\n",
      "My build is in my flair, but to expound on the details... it was built as a cheapass rig that I could upgrade further once I had more funds at my disposal - a plan which I've been able to follow in 2015, and trying to do the same this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, in 2014, the build was:\n",
      "\n",
      "* i3-4130 (got on about 20% discount). There have been mentions of dualcore pentiums being less than adequate for certain games,  and the price on the i3 looked... well, good. \n",
      "* 2x4GB DDR3 (second-hand, saved about 25% on store price)\n",
      "* MSI Z87-G43. One part of the rig I don't intend to switch out for the foreseeable future. Wanted a H87 board, found Z87 on discount for nearly the same price.\n",
      "* MSI Radeon HD 7770 gHz Edition. Not very good, better than nothing, fit in my budget.\n",
      "* Thermaltake Smart SE 530W. Cheap, but not total shit - I've gone over reviews of this thing before I bought it.\n",
      "* Bitfenix Comrade case. Probably the one thing I took the most time to decide on. It's kind of cramped, but has decent features and does not look like an abstract art piece.\n",
      "* Two Seagate Barracuda 7200.12's. One I already had for five years and another bought second-hand. Since my previous experiences with hard drive failures were not pleasant, I'm running them in RAID-1.\n",
      "* Windows 7 64-bit from MSDNAA / DreamSpark\n",
      "* BD/DVD combo drive (had reasons to want that, found a cheapass second-hand one again)\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all it came to about $500 (plus $100 for a Benq GL2250 display)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since things have gone better for me financially in 2015, I've added:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Crucial MX100 120 GB SSD . Not the largest, but does not need to be - it's set up with Intel's Smart Response Technology (a feature on some of their higher-end boards) so that half of its capacity is a hugeass cache for the hard drives, boosting their read performance on commonly accessed data, and the remaining half I can use as a normal SSD. This was part of my reason for going with H87 / Z87 in the first place: Smart Response Technology allows the SSD to be an easy drop-in upgrade.\n",
      "* MSI GTX 970 100Me . Certainly not the bleeding edge of graphics technology, but a massive improvement over the HD 7770. \n",
      "\n",
      "My current plans for it include upgrading the CPU, RAM, power supply (want something more reliable) and storage, in that exact order. Will probably go for an i7 4790K, to make it a meaningful upgrade over the i3. \n",

      "I have been incorrectly diagnosed with different mental illnesses throughout my life, ranging from ADD to Bipolar Disorder. After a great deal of research of the symptoms of various mental conditions I have concluded that there is nothing 'wrong' with me. I have a hard time dealing with people I do not know closely, even extended family. I avoid eye contact at almost all costs. I don't like to talk much, and I'm usually very quiet and introverted. When I get excited I unconsciously flap my hands around like you may have seen an Autistic kid do. I have an IQ of 140+ and anger teachers when I raise my hand during class only to correct their mistakes. (What am I supposed to do, let it go? She was responsible for teaching the students of TWO school districts English and she can't even SPELL properly? I could spell better than that in 1st grade, and I'm not exaggerating.) I was born with a 'good' case of Asperger's Syndrome. And apparently I'm the only person qualified to give that diagnosis, seeing as the countless medical 'professionals' I've seen were completely ignorant. Especially my last doctor. My mom brought me to yet another one of these supposedly highly educated individuals for my 'abnormal' behavior. After several whole minutes of interviewing me and asking about my 'symptoms', (mostly being answered by my mom,) She returned with around 1.2 starter packs of Seroquel. I don't remember the exact dosage schedule she prescribed for me, only that by the seventh day I was supposed to have worked up to a staggering 1200mg a day. In retrospect, this dosage is far beyond the amount any 'sane' doctor would prescribe, (the truth being that NO sane doctor would ever prescribe this horrible substance to anyone other than a violent insomniac psychopath,) and this woman should probably have her medical license revoked. I won't even go in to how she made my mom suffer by denying her adequate pain medication. Anyway, the next morning I took the first dose, 25mg before school. I had been in class no more than 15 minutes when I suddenly became EXTREMELY tired and generally just 'down' and was unable to remain awake. Unfortunately for me, we had a substitute teacher for that class that day, and besides the fact that he made us do all our assignments seperately, (normally we do them in our designated groups and print them off en masse to save time and work, as this is a dual-enrollment class and it's not the teacher's problem if people want to be uneducated morons who fail his class,) he WOULD NOT allow me to sleep. My normal teacher was very easygoing and would let me sleep on the floor as long as I completed the homework and satisfactorily and didn't blatantly disregard the rules. This was quite a dilemma, although I was not too aware of it at the time due to the quetiapine robbing me of my consciousness and my soul. Eventually the inhumane asshole of a sub got pissed at my being incapacitated and moved me to some desk by myself. I don't remember clearly, but I think I attempted to muster up enough strength and sheer willpower to feign an attempt at conscious activity. I didn't receive any disciplinary action for my 'insubordination' (involuntary incapacitation) although I'm sure he left a note to my teacher, probably not detailing the situation truthfully. Either way, I eventually got the ridiculous assignment done and turned in the following day. The rest of the day was fairly uneventful, as I thankfully had only one sub, and the quetiapine simply forced me to do what I was already likely to do, sleep. However I fell into a deep sleep during my fourth hour class, and awoke half way through his fifth hour Wester Civ class, to great humorous effect to all but me. I hurried to my correct fifth hour classroom and had no problems. As I implied earlier, I have no trouble with schoolwork other than complete monotony, and because of this teachers either love me or consider me the bane of their very existence. Thankfully most of my teachers, including my fifth hour teacher, like me, because I am quiet, intelligent, and obedient (when it behooves me.) Needless to say, I never took the next dose. When I returned to the doctor and told her I refuse to take it because of it's terrible sedation, she actually yelled at me. She was on a major power trip and was saying things like 'I'm the doctor, I'm the one who went to medical school. I get to choose what medications you take, NOT you.' This is how dangerous the idea of an authoritarian medical system really is. These ignorant fools are given a book and a little hands-on training and told to memorize some facts, and suddenly they are handed a piece of paper and become infallible gods. The truth is, that these people only know the very little that they see, they are not necessarily more intelligent than any other human, and that I and only I decide what substances enter my body, as per my First Amendment rights. I never saw that doctor again for obvious reasons. Not only did I come to that psycho for mental help, she completely berated and trivialized me based on an obviously worthless piece of paper and her ego. That is insanity. To summarize, this drug is concentrated coma in a pill. It was designed, and primarily functions, as an antipsychotic.\n",

I have put in hundreds of hours on the 2k games on console and would really love to play the new one, i tried it out in free weekend at a friends and would absolutely love to play it more.\n",

      "So the developers got spike lee to work on this joint and it looks way more interesting and in depth than the story on 2k15, which just was a massive grind with not much player interaction. The story is more like an interactive movie now. Written and directed by Spike Lee, titled Livin Da Dream. you’re dropped into the life of a high school phenom from Harlem with dreams of the NBA, and starting from high school lets you feel the character as you advance up and into the NBA, but first you have to get recruited by colleges and universities and play for them to hopefully get into the draft. the focus is being the story and making choices that benefit the character, directly interacting with them and feeling for them. I feel really excited to have a go playing through this if i receive the game\n",
      "\n",
      "**Gameplay**\n",
      "\n",
      "So I've been reading a hell of a lot of reviews and i have concluded that despite bugs the gameplay is the best in the series yet, after the rookie season there are 82 game seasons and new exciting ways to improve your player on the off days. You have the option to decide exactly what you’re going to be doing with your free time during your career. Whether you want to work on establishing sponsorship deals, make friends with some of the best players around the NBA or simply attending a Live Practice to improve your skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, NBA has shown once again the great mechanics it has. With the addition of dedicated bounce pass and lob buttons, which each have double tap functions that allow you to throw flashy passes or alley oops, respectively, players feel more in control of their players than ever before. And comparing to this years NBA live which i haven't taken a look it,  these new mechanics, as well as the addition of over 1000 new animations give nba2k16 a massive leg up, there are also 32 post moves ! 2k have done a good job upon improving the already solid mechanics and features that were in 2k15\n",

      "Myteam has always been the main focus of online, and despite 2ks shoddy pc servers i have always loved playing it, even more so with friends. 'NBA 2K‘s version of the popular “It’s a Card Game and a Sports Game”'\n",
      "\n",
      "MyTeam allows you to earn NBA 2K16‘S second currency through every move you make across a bunch of awesome and exciting  game modes. From Challenge mode, which places restrictions on your team in exchange for the chance at extra currency to The Gauntlet, a mode in which players have to win consecutive 3-on-3 matches against other online users to continue, I personally always enjoyed working towards new and better players, it's one of my pet addictions, i love games where you can upgrade throughout and 2k16's gamesmodes are brilliant at this. Combine MyTeam with the  custom MyLeague and MyGM modes, which are always exciting for those who are looking to fantasy draft over and over, and conclude that NBA 2K16 is NOT short on content and you can sink tons of hours just like the previous games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now even though 2k is never the best with the servers there are some big improvements this year. The new system for matching players of similar experience in Play Now Online is a fantastic change and a tension-filled climb up a ladder of online players in The Gauntlet sounds really fun.\n",

      "**Other Game Modes**\n",
      "\n",
      "Expanding on MyGM and Myleague modes, if you didn't know these modes are modes that add onto the experience. MyGm is a game mode about managing, it is your responsibility to manage the roster, coaching staff, stadium facilities, and making the owner happy. Aside from players' and coaches salaries, you have to handle their egos, and maintain their morale. A player can come to you and let you know how he feels about his playing time, contract, or relationship with another player. If your player is unhappy, his performance on the court is going to suffer. It is up to you as a GM to decide how you will handle the situation. And myleague is a more casual simple version for those who like to manage but casually\n",

      "**Friends**\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, one of the best parts of sports games are friends. you cannot leave out the friends, talking to each other, laughing and competing with each other is a very big focus of why i like to play sports games such as 2k. I have friends that have been begging me to get this and i absolutely love doing bets and a mode of challenges with each other online, pack opening challenges, wagers, restrictions.

      "\n",
      "There are two ways this is currently accomplished, that I know of: Cyclotrons and Gaseous Diffusion Plants. Cyclotrons spin the mixed fuel really fast, so the isotoped end up sorted by mass; they then scoop out nuclear fuel from the band that they want. Gaseous diffusion plants do something different, but as I understand it thery're a lot less effecient and there's really only one of them in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, both of those methods require a LOT of energy; you can't really miniaturize a cyclotron and still have it do its job.

His personal line of research was in Flame Spectrometry, which has to do with what wavelenghts of light things give off when they burn; this is related to a reverse process, where you can heat up specfic elements by bombarding them with radiation at a certain wavelength (this is how microwaves work.) This gets very specific - it's possible to excite not just specific elements, but even specific isotopes. My grandfather was hoping to refine fissilie material by using lasers to burn off selected isotopes.\n",

      "It didn't work; the laser technology in the era just wasn't good enough. However, we have much nicer lasers now, so the technology may become feasible soon, if it hasn't already. Unlike cyclotrons or gasseous diffusion, this technology could be mad small - it would still be an expensive and difficult process, but it would be a great deal easier to hide what you were doing than with the other methods.\n",

      ">It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime.  Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly.  The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility.\n",

      "But is the card itself bad?no. The digital foundry benchmarks clearly show 20-30% improvement over stock 980 ti even at 4k. And second his point on over clocking. A decent 980 ti reaches peak of 1400mhz(including after market coolers) very few hit the 1500 mark , I taking the average case. stock base clock is 1000mhz , so it reaches +400Mhz max. Now stock clock of 1080 is 1607. And most people agree FE it can hit the 1950 without any thermal throttling issues which is +350Mhz. An after market version can easily hit 400+ Mhz extra clock easy.

That is a design decision I will never agree with.  Games should always be winnable for the player.

      "Rooney: Absolutely wonderful to watch. Got stuck in, made most of his passing count, wasn't afraid to run through the Russian players. As a long-time United fan (disclaimer here in case of bias) I've always thought he'd do better as an attacking midfielder than as a striker. Would love to see more of this please, Mr Rooney! 9/10  \n",

      "Hello.   First I want to share an ancedote.   I have gamed on AMD hardware for most of my teenage life and into my now early 30's adult life.  My first computer, an old 486/dx2 with a 66mhz \"turbo\" button had an old ATI Rage graphics card in it.  Through the years I have predominantly used ATI/AMD cards in different flavors including 9700pro, All-In-Wonder and a few other randoms.   The last AMD graphics card I bought was a r9 270x to replace my HD7770.   About two years ago I went balls to the wall and upgraded my rig to the most expensive and impressive I could shell out and dove in and got an ROG Swift mated to 2 GTX970 reference models.   I felt dirty but it was my money and at the time the GTX970 was crushing it for 350 bucks.  I then opted to move to 1440p 144hz and gsync.   I REALLLLY want to go back to team red, really, I always felt like AMD was more for me.   I still have my [128mb RX300](http://imgur.com/fuIK002) that I bought thinking I was so cool back in the day when everyone else was clammoring for xbox 360.  I hope Polaris and Zen are the upswing, I really do,  I would rather give AMD my money instead of Nvidia-Intel.   Nvidia feels too stuffy to me,  and Intel is fucking evil and ruthless with the bullshit they pull behind the scenes.\n",

      "Second is a question about Freesync vs G-Sync vs Adaptive-Sync.   It is my understanding that Freesync is a variation of Adaptive-Sync and that the current marketing of AMD on it's behalf is disingenous in that Adaptive Sync being a VESA standard is free to use.  A good analog I have seen brought up in a discussion was that AMD claiming to have created/developed Free Sync would be like Canonical claiming to have invented Linux because Ubuntu.    **What features did AMD develop to further or differentiate FreeSync from Adaptive-Sync?  Followup:  Does AMD have a solution for Fast-Sync which solves the opposite issue as V/G/Fast/Adaptive Sync?**  \n",

      "Thirdly I have another question about Freesync.  Most blind tests have people choosing GSync over FreeSync.  I have only ever played on one FreeSync monitor at a LAN party awhile back and it looked ok to me, however that isn't nearly enough to make a good oppinion.   I have been using my GSync Asus ROG Swift for awhile now and I can tell the difference between GSync and VSync and it is a huge one.  Does AMD plan to ever include a hardware module into their designs similar to the physical GSync module? \n",

      ">With Tom's Hardware reporting that the RX 480 draws (substantailly) more than the 75W allowed from the motherboard (for example, the PCI Express high-power card spec allows a mazimum of 66W to be drawn from the 12V pins of the PCI Express slot, and the RX 480 averages79W from the 12V lines alone) AMD seems to be violating the PCI Express(R) spec.\n",
      "\n",
      ">According to the licensing contract for the spec, if they do not fix this within 3 months, AMD will NOT be able to call the card a PCI Express card. If they do, they face not only litigation, but if my understanding is correct an action before the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban the importation of the card as counterfeit goods. You might think the PCI-SIG will give AMD a pass, but if they do, they risk loosing the trademark entirely. An unforced trademark gets invalidated. The SIG won't let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      ">So what does this mean to the consumer? I think there are two possibilities, if we assume AMD will not choose to remove the PCI Express logos from these cards: Either they will alter the boards to have an 8-pin socket and to more power from there, or they will neuter the card to ensure it doesn't draw more power than the PCI Express specification allows. I don't see any other options.\n",

      "I'm currently building one of these: www.finalkey.net, an absolutely lovely little hardware encrypted password manager. One of the parts is still in the mail. They're quite neat, it generates and stores random passwords up to 32 characters in length, allows for storing up to 256 accounts including the login. Doesn't require any software installation whatsoever, usable over screen or with the project creator's GUI (entirely open source hardware and software). Acts as a USB HID device, so when you want to login to an account you select the account either over a serial connection (in screen or the likes), or through his GUI, select the entry box and hit the button on the device. The device types it all out for you. Really neat stuff for anyone who would like to keep their passwords handled locally over secure hardware (paranoid by design).

I then requested a meeting with each of their principles and asked that my child be present during said meeting. I told each of my children to kick the living fuck out of any student that    bullied them from that point on. Both of the schools had a \"zero\" tolerance stance. I told each of my kids in front of the principal that if they are expelled for defending themselves at school or on the bus that I will not punish them at all and that I would most likely reward them depending on the circumstance. 2 weeks later my son had had enough of getting  smacked in the head on the bus. He proceeded to do exactly what I told him to do. Guess what...the bus driver never reported the incident and he was NEVER bullied again.

You have less than a 4% chance of having a gay son or daughter, and around .3% of having a transgender offspring. If you think those odds are significant enough to start calling your son or daughter \"they,\" then go ahead.

There were some dull moments here and there, and a lot of it is due to some of the actors and their respective roles, but I can almost forgive it due to the movie's unexpected length. It's just one small twist after another after another that kept pushing the story to a somewhat inevitable yet totally not-so-obvious conclusion. It broke my heart in places I didn't even know were still in tact. I'm glad I saw it. Admittedly, my exposure to K-Pop and Koreanovelas kind of made it feel like a special TV episode but on the whole, it's a fantastic zombie movie, and probably one that will not tire from repeated viewings.\n",

We got to a room full of what looked like a bunch of terrorists and gunned down all but one. Now, this is where it starts getting really frisky. So we get to this guy, and pull his pants down and he had like a 10 inch by 3 inch schlong hard as fucking adamantium, smell and all. Me, Emma, and Taylor are just sitting there with our mouths agape when suddenly Emma says to me \"hey, you should totally fuck him\" and Taylor chimes in too and they both start chanting and I cant stop myself from getting on top of him and mounting it. Now I felt like I was in a trance and I slowly lowered myself onto him (facing towards Emma and Taylor and away from him) and felt a very warm and hard sensation slowly fill me up and once I got all of his dick in, I just stopped, like I couldnt physically make myself move anymore. Then he grabbed both my arms, pulled them back, and just went straight to poundtown. Like, I didnt feel any pain, just an immense amount of pleasure I cant compare to anything else I have felt in life. I could hear the squleching sound as he pounded in and out, my own moaning, and Emma and Taylor cheering me on. I could feel the climax coming, my moans were getting louder, my legs were shaking and losing strength and I started blacking out. Then, right before I climaxed, I woke up. I got cockblocked by myself.\n",

      "I'm big on Asian history, and to me China in particular has a few pretty incredible (and hugely influential) events that almost no one knows about.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the An Lushan Rebellion (755-763 A.D.):\n",
      "\n",
      "An Lushan was a Tang dynasty General, likely of (central Asian) turkish decent, who had risen both for his military skill and his status as a court favourite to become, in effect, the commander of all garrisoned troops in North China-- an extraordinarily powerful post, as the 164,000 troops stationed on the northern border were some of the most hardened veterans in the army, in addition to being the best equipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before going further it's important to know that the Tang dynasty is widely considered China's golden age. At its height in this period, historians estimate that Tang China accounted for 35% of global population and 50% of global GDP*, and that extraordinary figure spurred an explosion in city life, building, and culture-- though some of the greatest, most enduring art to come out of the period, the poetry of Du Fu, would derive from the sorrows of its destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by the time of An Lushan things were rotting just a bit: the armies were overextended (to the point where they were fighting the Abbasid Caliphate in the far east in 751), the coffers were running low, and the Emperor Xuanzong, though responsible for bringing the Tang to its apogee, had grown old, and allowed his favourites --Li Linfu, Yang Guozhong, and An Lushan (who hated each other)-- to accumulate more and more power. In addition, there had been a series of natural disasters and poor harvests, which was a HUGE deal. Not only does a poor harvest make people hungry, and thus, angry, it is also one of the traditional signs that the Emperor had lost the Mandate of Heaven – the divine right to rule granted, in ancient Chinese culture, to emperors not by blood, but by their ability to govern effectively and fairly. It sounds mystical, but if your government can no longer repair the river dams after a flood and provide grain from the communal silos, then suddenly “natural disasters mean heaven in angry with you” is a very practical consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, the Mandate of Heaven, once lost, can be claimed by anyone; in fact, it is sort of a self fulfilling prophecy, in that, if you are able to become Emperor, you must have it to have succeeded. So in comes An Lushan.  The planning took almost nine years, and though Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong tried warning the Emperor once the preparations became obvious enough to notice, the doting old guy was pushing 72, and they had a history of hating each other. There were lots of schemes at this point, but the bottom line is this: on December 16, 755, An Lushan decamped, taking his army south to the Eastern Capital of Luoyang, and respectfully accepting the surrender of Tang officials as he went, with many swelling his numbers. This was important too, because after reaching Luoyang, An waited until New Years day (Chinese- 5th of February, 756) to declare himself Emperor of the Yan Dynasty-- with all those officials as his new administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, though, it all went bad for the new Emperor: the Tang were not going down without a fight, and a bloody one. Court scheming and incredible incompetence meant that the two generals who should have held an invincible position from which to prevent An's armies from reaching the actual capital of Chang'an were executed, and their replacement order to attack An on open ground instead of holding the mountains. This was a major loss, both in lives and territory, and caused the  Emperor Xuanzong to have to flee to Sichuan, where he abdicated in favour of his son. An had major setbacks of his own, though: the fortified city of Suiyang was garrisoned by 7,000 men prepared to fight to the death, and led by brilliant commanders. To steal from Wikipedia (because I'm lazy and it's cool): \n",
      "\n",
      ">Despite daily sieges by the Yan army, the Tang soldiers never let up. Zhang Xun's troops played the war-drums during the night, acting as if they were going to fight (a tactic that army apparently had used before). Consequently, the Yan army were forced to stand on guard during the night, and suffered from the lack of sleep. Eventually, some troops did not bother to put on their armor when they heard these battle drums, and kept sleeping. After the Yan army lowered their defenses, Zhang Xun's forces ambushed them very successfully.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Zhang Xun had long wanted to give the Yan morale a major blow, and the best way to do this would be to hurt or kill the Yan general Yin Ziqi. However, in an age before photography, the problem was that Zhang had no idea what Yin Ziqi looked like, not to mention he would be in a mix of soldiers. Zhang therefore turned to psychology. He ordered his troops to shoot weeds, instead of arrows, at a few enemy soldiers. When these soldiers noticed that they were being shot by weeds, hence were not killed, they were overjoyed. They promptly ran to Yin Ziqi to report that the Tang army had already run out of arrows. Zhang Xun noticed where the soldiers ran and ordered his best archers to shoot at Yin Ziqi. One such arrow hit Yin Ziqi in his left eye, throwing the Yan army instantly into chaos. The siege ended with the expected major blow to the Yan morale.\n",
      "\n",
      ">After 16 days of siege and ambush, Yan had already lost 20,000 men. Yin Ziqi decided that his army was too tired to fight, so he ordered a temporary retreat to regroup. Yin Ziqi returned to besiege Suiyang two months later, with an additional 20,000 fresh troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took two years before the city fell (757), with rumours of cannibalism and only 400 men still alive “without the strength to shoot arrows.” That was two years where the fall of southern China was prevented, and in which the Tang were able to go from the underdogs to numerical superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line is that this sort of carnage and the upheaval that went with the movement of armies of hundreds of thousands (An's Yan Dynasty army peaked at 300,000) was commonplace. An Lushan himself suffered another rather large setback when, having become a temperamental, vicious son of a bitch (who'd frequently whip, cane, or execute servants) due to the suffering caused him by progressive blindness and ulcers, his son decided to kill him on January 29th, 757. But even then the bloodshed didn't stop-- his son thought being an Emperor might be alright, so he continued the rebellion until he was killed by one of dad's generals in 759, Sim Siming, who had the same idea, and who was then killed by his son, Shi Chaoyi, in 761. This rather high executive turnover proved to be less than effective, and under pressure from Arab and Persian pirates looting the coast, the Tang armies pushing in on land, and the defection of the Tang administrators who had previously defected to them, the rebellion finally folded in 763, and Emperor Shi Chaoyi commited suicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, all that is fascinating, but here's the reason its a big deal: remember when I said the Tang was China's golden age? 35% of global population, 50% of global GDP? Well, the Tang also kept amazing records, and in 755, just before the rebellion, they recorded a population of 52,919,309 in 8,914,709 tax paying households. In 764, the year after it ended, the census recorded only 16,900,000 people in 2,900,000 households. The An Lushan rebellion killed or displaced 36 million people-- one sixth of the population of the planet at that time. I want to be very clear- almost no serious historian would claim they were all dead, especially as territory with significant population was lost, but famine was a major issue, body counts were high, and the kind of physical displacement and disorganization suggested by losing that many people still marks it as one of the most incredible, and the fastest, examples of any society falling apart. Short of the migration of the Huns and the conquests of the Mongols, I can't think of much else that compares-- and they took a lot longer than 8 years.\n",

      "I am not a historian, but I will go and propose the [Battle of Blue Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blue_Waters).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fought on 1363, it was the first time in Eastern European history that the Golden Horde was inflicted a major defeat - and I mean *major*. Lithuania's territory almost doubled after the victory, capturing Kiev and taking control of it. The blow inflicted on the Horde was eventually one of the main factors that led to the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, and eventually rid Eastern Europe of Tatar influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "After victory in Blue Waters, Lithuania solidified it's place as a major competitor for the successor of the Kievan Rus as well as overcame Moscow in that department, as well as strengthened it's rule over what was left of modern day Belarus and northern Ukraine. Had Algirdas lost this battle, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth would likely been weaker or never even happened at all, the battle of Grunwald would have likely never happened and the Teutonic Knights would have likely stood as a major force, and the Eastern Slavs,would have stayed under Tatar influence for many years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medieval Lithuania was a badass in general. A pagan nation formed in the midst of Christians willing to crush it at a glance, and not only did it survive, but within the span of a hundred years it forged a massive empire in Eastern Europe and beat back Teutons, Slavs, Poles and Tatars alike in the process.\n",
      "\n",

      "While this was a huge blow to the Soviet Union, the long-term effects proved murderous for the Second Polish Republic. An identity crisis ensued as newborn Poland was unsure whether to become a nation-state, like Germany to its west, or to become a multiethnic nation, like the Soviets to the east. Its demographics lay directly between the two attitudes, both in numbers and in political views. Political instability defines Poland between 1920 and 1939; this shaky situation would create a weak, ineffectual Polish state which would soon be preyed upon by Nazi Germany.\n",

It's unique because it takes you through the opposing theories that failed along the way. It all seems well and good until you watch the third and final episode.

      "1. The base line for the leaks, ok so the CIA is a spy agency that can hack into foreign governments and hack into smart devices, woop-de-doo. You expect me to act surprised? It only confirmed Snowden's leaks. Oh and by the way, [WIRED even hacked some guy's smart car on the freeway](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) so if they can do that I'm pretty fucking sure the CIA could as well.\n",

That timing is way too fucking suspicious and with their involvement of the email scandals of John Podesta and the DNC in the election hurts their credibility. \n",

      "3. And finally, their credibility. Wikileaks' emails on John Podesta helped spark the infamous \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory which [they themselves have tweeted about](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/821595404500430848) so they support it, which [Michael Flynn's son has tweeted about in support of](https://twitter.com/mflynnjr/status/839877413660147713) and which lead to the conspiracy theorist [firing shots at the Comet Ping Pong shop.](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Comet-Ping-Pong-Shooter-Indicted-on-Gun-Charges-406890795.html) Luckily no one was hurt but Wikileaks would've had blood on its hands.

      "This is such bullshit on multiple levels:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.) Obviously, fictional media doesn´t cause pedophilia. Pedophilia is a sexual attraction that, unfortunately for those impacted by it, isn´t compatible with our societal norms. You don´t choose your sexual attraction, just like you don´t choose to be gay. And in-before: Yes, idiots often like to declare pedophilia a mental illness, not a sexual attraction, but that´s just part of the stuck-up ignorant morality of society: If they acknowledged it as a natural sexual attraction, it´d be harder to condemn pedophiles as monsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) By claiming \"causes Pedophilia\", this article is, from the very start, painting pedophiles as bad people. This is the biggest bs that always gets me angry: Most pedophiles are absolutely decent people that never commit a crime. We only hear about the bad pedophiles (aka sex criminals), because no sane pedophile would ever reveal himself. If you reveal yourself as a pedophile in our current society, you get reactions from the entire spectrum, ranging from simply being shunned and outcast by people, to being talked into inhumane chemical castration, up to straight forward death wishes. If it wasn´t clear, no, I´m not a pedopihle, but I´m sick how assholes attack them, just because they´re such an easy target that cannot defend itself. And even SJW assholes like the people at NeoGAF that are all for gay people and transgender and such, wish death to pedophiles. Fuck them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) Strictly speaking about the word \"promoting\": Wrong. Lots of anime feature young, hot girls. But guess what: The entire world loves young, hot girls. What you have in school girls in Japan, are cheerleaders in the USA. Add to that that manga/anime often (mostly) target a younger audience and you should understand why there are young girls. Although I can hardly think of any sexualized loli characters in the recent years. Usually, girls in anime are young, but have bodies that rival the hottest adult woman, talking about cup size, waiste line and thighs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) Let´s assume certain content is enjoyed by pedophiles: For fucks sake, it´s FICTIONAL. Let them have something. As mentioned above, most pedophiles are poor, unfortunate souls that live in constant fear of being found out and can never truly have the  kind of relationship that would make them happy. So, for chrissake, let them fap to some loli-hentai doujin. There´s no victim. \n",
      "\n",
      "5.) And regardless of who enjoys whatever content: FUCK CENSORSHIP. Stop limiting creative freedom of authors and artists. If something flops commercially, the market will regulate itself, less content of a certain kind will be made. That´s how capitalism works. But stop it with the censorship, just because something hurts your own, ignorant morality. I´m not into it, but for all that´s worth, have there be games/anime/manga where 5-year olds are gang raped. It doesn´t matter how disgusting something is, AS LONG AS IT´S FICTIONAL. Thx to idiots like that woman, Nintendo removed the breast slider from Xenoblade X, complete screwed over Tokyo Mirage Sessions, and changed text in Fire Emblem Fates. Just stop this crap. No censorship. How hard can it be?\n",

      "*disclaimer* i fully support equal rights for LGBTQ+ people, so please dont misconstrue this as hatred or homophobia. However, the way our school implemented this system was ridiculous. They literally just took off the gender signs and got rid of the urinals, now an 18-year old boy can walk into the same bathroom as an 11-year old girl, which, after speaking to them, makes them feel very uncomfortable. As it should. The worst part is that we have 2 trans/non-binary kids in our school, and they weren't even lobbying to implement this. The disabled and staff toilets are gender neutral and they have only one stall, so surely it would make sense to let those students use those bathrooms, but of course there would be a big flap about 'just because my kid is transgender doesnt mean theyre disabled.' Even in that instance, the school could construct one-stall bathrooms specially for gender-neutral kids, but because our school is run by idiots and we have little funding,the whole student body has been left feeling uncomfortable. I hope the school sees sense soon and rethinks this abomination of a system.\n",

For example, if the ownership of a specific product can be guaranteed by a platform and accepted, trusted by all the players in the whole supply chain, it will no longer be necessary for labor and paper documentation to trace said products in every warehouse during each step of the supply chain from the manufacturer to the consumer. Big costs will be saved, and the whole supply chain made more efficient.”(*Mr.Qian was also former executive of IBM... connections)>>>\n",

      "-Yup this is huge. Many Fortune 500 Companies will use VeChain, this is all connected. Look how R3 of Cordera is connected to PwC and connected to Microsoft(I said this on 1/10/18). Wow Trillions guys, trillions will run off this platform, and if you trust Coca Cola Kid the PBoC would validate my claim. All the links are here, they just haven't announced it. And I am going to reiterate something Sunny mentioned in my own words. Paraphrasing, Sunny stated that each company that launches on VeChain is their own independant business. So what that means is that their success or failure is seperate from VeChain. VeChain is just the code or protocol or net, however you describe it, that these companies use. All companies used to use fax everyday. VeChain will be the \"fax\" that all companies use. But every successful Fortune 500 launch only strengthens VeChain. They are taking a page from IOTA but not actually in physical code(but from Bosch too lol). Every company that is successful makes Thor and VET that much more valuable and stable because of an ecosystem. But VeChain is priming to become, again, \"THE Chain\" to overtake Crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Now on Amazon's own site they describe PwC as partners. Deloitte, which is also listed on this site as blockchain is PARTNERED W/ DNG VL in BLOCKCHAIN(wow so PwC to VeChain, DNG VL to VeChain, Deloitte to DNG VL ALL PARTNERED IN BLOCKCHAIN. So many connection that speak to a 'Consortium'...). On their ICO \"Quorum\" it explicity states that they will use an Etherum fork, which is exactly what Sunny described VeChain to be. So connect the dots, Amazons website, 5 BRAND NEW ICO's FROM FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES (T Mobile, JP Morgan, Amazon, PwC, Samsung, Microsoft, Deloitte). Common now, you can't be that stupid to think that all these connections don't somehow one way or another line up(consortium). It's going big guys, I provided the links, make the connections yourself now. \"An Ethereum based platform that can host fortune 500 companies\". How more obvious can you get lol.\n",

      "Ryan, consider me a lost subscriber. Instead of addressing these allegations seriously, you instead took pages to say nothing substantive with regards to conflicts of interest. This isn't a complicated issue. You don't get to decide whether getting paid by a company would lead you to biased conclusions. It's like a drunk driver claiming they drive fine after 8 drinks, so other drivers shouldn't complain. As a journalist, you have the responsibility to maintain financial independence from companies or individuals that you cover. That's not an ideal, that's a base expectation that you failed to meet. You know this, and instead of admitting that you failed to do so, you are instead trying to PR your way out of addressing your failures.

There should have been a disclaimer at the beginning of every single one of your content pieces informing the audience very clearly that you have been paid by that manufacturer for services relating to that (or other) product.

AMD/INTEL don't give a shit if you lack integrity, so long as you provide the services they want from you. Their approval has no bearing on your moral standing.

In sum, virtual currencies (e.g. Bitcoin) are considered commodities. Current law does not provide any U.S. Federal regulator with regulatory oversight authority over cash/spot virtual currency markets/platforms operating in the United States or abroad, but **Giancarlo calls for Congress to allow more regulatory oversight over crypto markets**. The CFTC *does* have authority to investigate and prosecute civil cases of fraud and manipulation in virtual currency derivatives markets and in underlying virtual currency spot markets, as well as regulatory and enforcement authority over derivatives on virtual currencies traded in the United States. Giancarlo discusses enforcement actions against fraudsters, working with Cboe on the Bitcoin futures, investor education efforts, and potential benefits from blockchain. \n",

Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. . . . The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination. With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity. \n",

But when our laws are not followed, the risks to all investors are high and numerous – including risks caused by or related to poor, incorrect or non-existent disclosure, volatility, manipulation, fraud and theft. To be clear, **I am very optimistic** that developments in financial technology will help facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. . . . At the same time, regardless of the promise of this technology, **those who invest their hard-earned money in opportunities that fall within the scope of the federal securities laws deserve the full protections afforded under those laws**.\n",

Many of these assertions that the federal securities laws do not apply to a particular ICO appear to elevate form over substance.  . . . **Merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security**. Tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law.\n",

In doing so, the SEC and CFTC are collaborating on our approaches to policing these markets for fraud and abuse.\n",

      "Obviously, the US Senators will have a chance to ask questions and weigh in during the hearing tomorrow, but based on this testimony it seems like the US plans to regulate cryptocurrency and token trading thoroughly, particularly ICOs that attempt to avoid securities regulations by claiming to be a “utility” token. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, “vigorous” regulatory enforcement can have some harsh results. If a company violates securities regulations in a coin/token offering, they could face fines and disgorgement (they have to pay the money back to the purchasers). We will likely see fewer “utility” token ICOs going forward because of this threat. Instead, we’ll see more companies taking advantage of exemptions that allow them to avoid securities registration where the coins/tokens are only offered to “accredited” investors (who either make >$200k per year or hold >$1MM in liquid assets). This, of course, means that “retail” investors (read “poor schmucks”) will have much fewer options available to them if they want to invest in crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, this stated commitment to enforcing the law is the kind of thing that could build confidence in crypto, leading to price increases and less volatility, which could lead to big money coming in from institutional investors. This could be the culling of the shitcoins that the crypto world so desperately needs right now, thus freeing up money for investment in projects with real promise.\n",

      "**TL;DR:** Knowing how to trade can help you understand the market better. By using both fundamentals and technical analysis you can get a feel of where the market is going. Trading experience definitely helps you, but not something to be *dependent* on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, 3 months of trading (as you wrote you started to learn it) is really *nothing*. People trade Forex, Stocks and what i hear the usual consistent profit zone is after **2-3 years of trading** (depending how much time you spent, but that is the average, because a person may spend 1-4 hours trading a day). So i would not trust your opinion because of lack of experience (no offense of course). All this TA stuff that you talk about, which people think is easy, is not, because it is not about drawing lines on the chart. Yes in practice it works sometimes, but like in Forex, only the **5-10%**  are profitable in that market. Crypto is different, because you can just expect the price to go up. \"Everyone's a genius in the bull market\".\n",
      "\n",
      "You can outline the major perk of good traders:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3 months only let's you get your toes wet. If people were profitable after 3 months like that, everyone would be doing it. So i wan't to clear that out first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the things you are correct for:\n",
      "\n",
      "> I got to the conclusion that it is a bit useful to know technical analysis to be more aware of the trends and helps a little to know when is a good time to buy, but difficult to know when is a good time to sell or difficult to know if, against all the odds, the price drops a lot and you lose a good amount of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is true from my personal experience and from people/reddit. You can figure out a price of where to enter when prices fall down, like recently, as there is **price structure** you can rely on. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is you don't really know where to exit out. The only indicator for me was fundamental analysis, of news of how Bitcoin was just *too* euphoric, which was time to get out. Also it was January and historically crypto is expected to fall in that month. But other than that it might be guessing of where the price stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can try using fib levels, market cycles or just price targets (BTCUSD 20 000) which can help you exit. But it is problematic, that you can't know if the last Bitcoin bull run would have gone up to BTCUSD 30 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crypto markets are **booming and doing it fast**. There is market manipulation and a lot of regulatory issues which make the price go in sometimes unexpected ways. Crypto has a lot of potential and probably right now investing and waiting is your best bet, because *adoption* of cryptocurrency is what is happening. Especially in 2018 as a lot of **promises have been made by Q1-Q4 of this year**. Therefore it might be best to hold it out, because this isn't a thing that is overvalued, but undervalued in the *long-term*. \n",
      "\n",
      "Short-term overvaluation happens like the recent BTC run up to 20 000. With BTC having so many issues with transaction fees, it was completely blown out of proportion and the market required a cooldown. The growth was just too fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Crypto investor** on youtube does pretty good calls at where to enter the market. He bought BTC at 8000 USD as he predicted the price would bonce from there and if you know how TA works, he was basically right. Price dipped below 8000, but afterwards stayed above and didn't go lower, indicating good support of that level. \n",
      "\n",
      "It definitely is possible, but you have to have the mentality and the knowledge of how markets work. 3 months won't get you anywhere. If you bought at 8000 and then saw the market go down to 6000 and posts saying BTC would go down to 3000, would you stay or would your weak hands get you out of the market? Again, it isn't just drawing lines on a chart.\n",

For me, it can feel like being trapped in quicksand. Sure, you can do things, but not without a tremendous effort on your part. One of the worst things about it is that it's not a physical ailment. You didn't catch it anywhere, so really you're not even sure if it exists at all, but at the same time you know it exists because you can feel it everywhere. All over your body. The initial thought process is that it's you, right? So all you really need to do is adjust your thoughts to get better, but now the depression is eating away at whatever made you feel capable of thinking positively at all. What now? Well, you're fucked in so many words. Because now it's a part of your identity. Every feeling or experience you have is filtered through it. It's like smoking a full strength cigarette and trying to enjoy a meal afterwards. Everything tastes like ash, and all you really want is for things to taste how they used to taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what now? Well you can get help. Maybe. If you can afford it. But help is hard to come by because therapy is expensive, and you're working, and you have social obligations, and this and this and this. You think, well hey, maybe this thing is just a phase that needs to work itself out on it's own. Because everything else that's ever been wrong with you in the past usually does at some point. So you wait. And all the while this mental infection it's growing at alarming rate, and more and more it feels like you're just doing a really bad impersonation of yourself. Even basic things feel impossible. You don't want to eat, you don't want to shower, you don't want to hang out with your friends. You don't want to do anything at all. And maybe you're not thinking about hurting yourself, but if you had to choose between existing and not existing you'd definitely have to think about it. And what's worse is that you can't really talk about it to anyone, because you don't want to be treated like some delicate flower. You don't want to be treated differently at all. But you know that if you admit it out loud to another person it's out there, and now this person is viewing you through that same depression filter. So you're alone. Your own private island that seems to be shrinking at all times. The sea level is rising fast. And all you can see for miles is nothing but water. \n",

It was about their journey of self discovery and it was also a tv show that had to captivate you and they did so with cliffhangers. There have been many shows and movies and even books about a person or more being \"lost\", and this show chose its own original setting, an island.\n",

I remember when they were on a boat and went past a huge foot that had only 4 toes that used to be part of an even bigger statue and all I could think of \"what the fuck?\" and throughout the show I used to talk with my friends about various LOST mysteries and kept bringing that up , but in the show no one seemed to care that much or even go and investigate it... for seasons in a row. I remember Sayid was quite impressed with it when he saw it, and pretty much all on the boat, but that was it... they were concerned with different things.\n",

Everyone was dismantling and analyzing every single screenshot, even the 30 second promos went through some thorough analyze just to try and figure out what will the next episode be about. I remember a screenshot from an episode/promo that saw Kate in a cave with symbols/hieroglyphs behind it and everyone tried to translate and find a meaning. It was awesome and episode after episode you knew you'd find out more and more about characters and the island with even more question rising and the reaction was normal to want to get to the bottom of everything. It meant the show as a whole achieved its purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think the show was about the bears, bird, dharma initiative, time travel and other mysteries. It was about the group of people lost on an island,  an island with a bit of \"magic\" behind it and a purpose.\n",
      "And the ending ... judging from all the guessing and all the hype built around the plethora or mysteries and questions, all the possibilities and guessing, I don't think they could have satisfied everyone by trying build the last episode to just answer everything. Bears were there for experiments and that statue's foot was just there , a random horse on the island and here's a bunch of dharma tapes that you haven't seen yet ... would have easily seemed not so big and maybe a bit disappointing like cheating on a puzzle by reading the solution.  The ending was great imo.\n",

I'm not sure how I feel about the middle connector that leads into long A. Forge never had it, original cbble never had it, not sure if this version needs it.

I bought it right at the end of the steam sale with some card money I'd collected during the sale, the last few cents literally came half an hour before the sale ended, so it was completely free. it's basically more of the same, but thankfully much shorter (about an hour) and less frustrating, and I'm finally done with it all.

I guess/hope I'll be done with the game one way or the other sometime in july, though that's when 4(!) new instances are supposed to make their debut, but without uber-awesome gear I won't stand a chance to even get into a team, so I won't even worry about it.\n",

I hit the desk so hard my hand still hurt 10 minutes later, but the very next try was finally successful, gold medal even, and I also beat my buddy's best time as a bonus. the game's usually more forgiving than this (like in the other problematic race, even after a crash I could finish in 3rd or 4th place), but in some cases it can be really frustrating.\n",

I finished it under 15 minutes and got bronze, and of course crashed a few times, including once about 200 meters before the finish line while I was in 4th place. luckily #3 had crashed just before me and I hit him and got back into the race at #3, otherwise it would've been 4th place and I probably wouldn't have tried it again. the race started in the afternoon and turned into night while driving, but the most atmospheric thing was probably an earlier pursuit, which started in the evening in the sunshine, but when I came out of the tunnel after a few miles, it clouded over, there was thunder and lightning, it started to get darker and the cops showed up.\n",

I already played **test drive unlimited** (didn't bother finishing all the races there, it was way too difficult, but I did what I could), and I still have **tdu2**, **fuel** and **burnout paradise** to play (and maybe **most wanted 2012**, I hear it's very similar to burnout), but that's it, and probably none of these will offer the same kind of fun as nfs:hp did (I remember the cops in tdu being total dicks, towards the end I had to turn them off so I could complete a few more races).\n",

      "You’ve [said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8520033/Stephen-Hawking-tells-Google-philosophy-is-dead.html) that “philosophy is dead” and “philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics.” What led you to say this? There are many philosophers who have kept up with physics quite well, including [David Albert](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/david-z-albert), [Tim Maudlin](http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/timmaudlin.html), [Laura Ruetsche](https://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/ci.ruetschelaura_ci.detail), and [David Wallace](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert0130/), just to name a very few out of many. And philosophers have played (and still play) an active role in placing the many-worlds view of quantum physics — which you [support](https://books.google.com/books?id=z9jH9mYiO5IC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false) — on firm ground. Even well-respected physicists such as Sean Carroll have [said](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/23/physicists-should-stop-saying-silly-things-about-philosophy/) that “physicists should stop saying silly things about philosophy.” In light of all of this, why did you say that philosophy is dead and philosophers don’t know physics? And do you still think that’s the case?\n",

      "Let me tell you the story of Yuri the Russian Diver. You see, Yuri, he's this middle-aged Russian worker. Hard worker, but he has to be, growing up in the poor neighbourhoods of Moscow. Doesn't like violence, so he doesn't join the army, and the only thing he's really good at is physical labour. Poor Yuri's daily routine was basically to get out of bed in his cramped, dirty little bachelor apartment, really just a hole in the wall, then walk to work through muddy streets in the summer, slushy streets in the winter, and break his back for ten hours a day to get paid thirty rubles a month. Every day, when he comes home, he falls asleep with the mantra in his head: Yuri, it's okay. Everyone has a difficult life here, and you are used to it. You are used to these hardships. Don't let them bother you. And every day, he'd wake up and do it all over again. But, one day, as he was walking home from the quarry, he sees this huge billboard on the side of a building that had just been put up. Rise of capitalism and all that jazz. On the billboard is a beautiful Russian woman in a bathing-suit, posing and flashing her pretty teeth. Under the woman is the address to the local gymnasium and the phrase: LEARN TO SWIM! TEN RUBLES! So, naturally Yuri is a bit hesitant. That's a third of his monthly earnings, but he sees the pretty girl on the advertisement and starts thinking, Yuri! Look at that! Maybe, if you go to the pool and learn to swim, you could meet a beautiful woman like that! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesn't have to be so dull! So, Yuri convinces himself to go. He saves up a bit of money, and sure enough, a week later he is at the gym and he slaps down the ten rubles to learn to swim. Now, while he didn't meet any beautiful women there because mostly it was just lonely guys who responded to the ad, he decided not to let that ruin the investment and he took to swimming with his entire being. His Russian work ethic made him excel in all his classes, and soon, he had learned the front stroke, the back stroke, and was swimming laps like an Olympic hopeful. For a time, he was very happy, but slowly, he realized he would not meet any beautiful women at the pool, and he was not learning anything else from the novice instructors. So, he goes back to his usual life of hardships, working at the quarry, and only goes to the pool once in a while when he has a day off to keep up his swimming. But then, one day, as he is returning from work...he sees that the billboard has changed. LEARN TO DIVE! TWENTY RUBLES! With the sexy Russian woman now in a two-piece suit, nonetheless. So, once again, Yuri says: Yuri! Look at that! Maybe, if you learn to dive, you could finally meet that beautiful woman, and at the very least, swimming will be exciting again! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesn't have to be so dull! Naturally, twenty rubles takes him a while to save up. He suffers incredible hardships, eating only the cheapest food. He doesn't pay his electricity bill for a month, and ends up spending many nights cold and shivering in addition to the usual hardships. However, it lasts only a few weeks and he has easily saved his rubles. Goes down to the gym and plunks down the money, informing the cashier that he intends to learn to dive! So, he puts all his effort into learning to dive.Learns the half-gainer, full-gainer, back-flips, swan-dives... Mastered it all in less than a week. Our man Yuri was making high-dives at the end of the month that would have put him on the jet to Olympia. Still, it wasn't enough to completely remove him from the hardships of reality. There were a few women in the class, but they were all future hopefuls that were ten or twelve years old. Yuri never met the hot woman from the billboard, but soon he was the best in his class...nay...in Russia! So he became dejected again with the fact that he could not learn anything more and started picking up overtime at the quarry instead of going to the pool. This only made him more miserable, and soon, he had accepted that his life of hardships was not going to get any better. Then, one day, he sees a new billboard up on the building as he's coming home from work. This one has a beautiful American woman on it, smiling and waving in front of the Statue of Liberty. Under the picture is: COME TO AMERICA! FIFTY RUBLES! Yuri sighs and convinces himself to keep walking. But the next day, and the next day, he sees that sign and that promise of a new life in America, and he gets to thinking: Yuri! What are you doing here? You are the best swimmer in all of Russia, and yet, you wallow in your life of hardships! You are the best diver in all of Russia, and yet you go every day to your depressing job! Yuri, maybe if you go to America, you can leave your life of tiring work and hardships behind, and finally meet some nice women! YES! Yuri, don't you see? This is a sign! So, Yuri begins to save up all his money. He eats nothing but the poorest food and even starts going to the homeless soup kitchen to make sure he is strong enough to keep working all the overtime he is pulling in. He sells all his worldly possessions minus a few sets of clothes and his bathing suit. Finally, after suffering incredible hardships - long, exhausting days and near-sleepless, shivering nights for an entire month - he is able to finally sell his little apartment and scrape together the fifty rubles plus food for the two-week-long trip by steamer. Yuri the Greatest Swimmer and Diver in all of Russia walks down to the harbour, finds the ticket counter and plops down the fifty rubles, saying to the lady: 'Take me to America! I am leaving this life of hardship behind!' Now, Yuri gets on the boat and they leave the port, heading West that very afternoon. It is a fine, sturdy boat, so his fears are lessened right away, and there are many other passengers who are like him, and who have even heard of Yuri's excellent skill at diving, so he has lots of people to talk to. In fact, he's almost a celebrity on board. But, with nothing to do but stare out the windows or wander around on the deck, everyone starts to get restless and bored. Yuri gets tired of talking about diving with everyone so he basically just sits in his cabin room and does nothing. But, of course, Yuri is used to hardships and manages to keep himself busy by imagining all the things he can do once he gets to America. In fact, one day, about half-way though the trip, he starts to figure out he could open up a swimming school, and this makes him very excited. Before he can start drawing out plans, however...BOOM! The boat slowly comes to a stop in the middle of the ocean and the captain comes onto the intercom. He says that one of the engines broke down and it will be at least three hours before they will be moving again. This makes all the bored people even more antsy, and Yuri hears many people grumbling and mad and complaining as he walks around that day. Suddenly, he comes up with an idea! He says to himself: Yuri, you are the best Swimmer in all of Russia, are you not? You are the best Diver in all of Russia, too! Why not use this time to enjoy the ocean and go for a dive? Surely the Captain wouldn't mind! And sure enough, word that an expert diver putting on a show circulates around the boat and the captain agrees, hoping it will entertain and calm the passengers as the repairs finish. The water is tranquil and beautiful. The air is warm and there have been no signs of sharks or danger for miles and miles. So, confident it is safe, Yuri finally runs to his cabin and changes into his bathing suit. He even looks at the clock to make sure he waited an hour after breakfast before swimming. When he comes up onto deck, most of the ship is there to watch. Everyone is excited and whispering: he's Yuri! The best Diver in all of Russia! This will be quite a show! Yuri, well, he is filled with happiness and confidence, so he declares to the crowd: I will attempt my highest dive ever from the top of the crow's nest! So, he climbs up the ladder to the crow's nest high above the deck. It takes him a few minutes to get up there, but by the time he has finished climbing, everyone is excited and even the crew is watching. So, without wanting to wait too long, Yuri stretches, readies himself, and even checks the air with a lick of his finger.\" Yuri takes a few steps back on the crow's nest, then runs and leaps into the air! Two back flips! Then, a corkscrew! Then, a front flip! Then...BAM! Yuri missed the edge of the boat and accidentally hit the metal deck! And everyone is sure he's hurt or dead, but as everyone comes running up to him, shouting 'Yuri! Yuri! Are you alright!?! Yuri! Are you hurt? Yuri!!!' he gets up, rubbing his head painfully. Then, he turns to the surprised audience, and says: 'It's okay. I'm alright. I'm used to hard-ships\n",

      "I have several relatives in Federal Law Enforcement. MOST LE is comprised of pathological liars, narcissistic sociopaths, violent psychopaths and troglodytes with double digit IQ’s. When LE ACTIVELY disqualifies people from being hired for being too intelligent, that's a problem. When you're 8 times more likely to be killed by LE than a terrorist, that's a problem. When LE in America discharges MORE rounds in 1 incident than the ENTIRE group of all law enforcement in Germany in 1 YEAR, that's a problem. When LE is militarized and taught that the civilians whom they are to \"protect and serve\" are the enemy, that's a problem. When it becomes impossible to fire a bad cop because of the \"thin blue line\" and their Union, that's a problem. When our incarceration rate in the US is the highest in the world per 100,000 citizens (by % AND total number incarcerated) and we are the ONLY industrialized nation with the death penalty, that's a problem.

      "I may be the only one here to say that I am 80% cool with this and think it's a spectacular idea.  You see, I am likely on of the only ones in this thread that has played a lot of COD on PC, and one of the things that each COD on PC has in common is it's horrible playerbase numbers.  BLOPS 2 is my most played game on Steam and at this point it's 24 hr peak is ~400 players, and it's one the higher games in the franchise in this respect.  The problem is that owners of the season pass cannot be grouped into the same matchmaking pool that non-owners are.  Further from that an owner of only one DLC pack can only be matchmade with like owners, or injected into an ongoing game on a DLC map they own, only to be swiftly booted if the lobby votes for a map they don't.  This move by Activision is genius, in that it means players will be in only two distinct player bases and this should reduce wait times significantly.  Why am I only 80% cool with this?  $50 is waayy to much for this content on PC.  Activision should drop the price to $30 and explain why they have done this and we can all be hunky dory.\n",

First off, we do not know yet exactly why the man was DETAINED (not necessarily arrested). They could of just questioned the man on what he was doing (recording the raid so closely or whatever reason) and just released him. In the end, we do not know. There is no immediate evidence that proves he was being arrested. PD can hold people in handcuffs and question them and it's not necessarily an arrest.\n",

It happened pretty much like yours: he checked my muscles, I was able to move them fine, it was just an undeveloped breast.

My brother and grandmother passed away in 2007 and I was alone at college (my own choice) over Christmas break.

It was snowing heavily and although it was beautiful, I contemplated suicide with the emptiness around me and that I felt inside.  I decided to turn on the TV for some distraction and Jackass was on.  It was only one episode, but it made me laugh.  I decided to pull myself together enough to go rent Jackass 1 & 2.  I watched both over and over through that night and laughed so hard I cried, but the right kind of tears.  I wanted to thank you for getting me through that awful night.

      "After the events that happened in Kiev in the last few months, Ukraine is heading toward the European Union now.\n",

      "Russia has a military base and presence in Crimea, with the acceptance of the Ukrainian government. But if Ukraine joins the European Union, I think the EU will interfere with the Russian presence/influence/power in Crimea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, what Russia wants is to maintain control/influence of Crimea even though Ukraine is heading towards EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin took this moment of weakness of the country to make a move on Crimea and deployed the military under the pretext of protecting the Russian ethnic population. There was no danger, there was no violence, but he used this pretext to deploy the military and gain control over the region in order to determine a scenario in which Russia continues to maintain control/influence of Crimea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the actions of Russia are completely unjustified, are an invasion under false pretenses, are an abuse of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin used the instability in Ukraine as an opportunity to make his move. Because if things stabilized and Ukraine was moving towards EU, there would have been no way to justify an intervention later and Russia would have lost position and influence in Crimea.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hard to say what will happen now. Crimea may break away from Ukraine and remain independent, or may move to Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "A referendum is planned later this month for the Crimean population to decide what they want but it is hard to legitimate a referendum when the army of another country is occupying the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, the best thing would be for the Russian army to retreat, bring stability back to the region and for the people to democratically decide what they want to do, not as a result of an invasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But basically, this whole thing happened because Putin saw that Ukraine is moving towards EU, it is in the advantage of Russia to remain in Crimea, invaded under false pretenses in order to determine a scenario in which it continues to maintain control/influence in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit:\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why the Russian ethnic population pretext was used was because a large part of the Crimean population is of Russian ethnicity. Historically, Crimea has ties with Russia. It used to be part of Russia in the Soviet Union, then it was transferred to Ukraine who was also part of the USSR. When USSR broke, Ukraine and Russia became separate countries and Crimea remained with Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course this does not change anything, just wanted to give a little more context of the history to better understand the situation and why this pretext was used. Ukraine is a sovereign nation, Crimea is part of Ukraine, this is still an illegitimate invasion under false pretenses, an abuse of power with the purpose of creating a geopolitical advantage for Russia.\n",

      "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n",
      "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n",
      "He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n",
      "He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n",
      "He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. \n",
      "He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. \n",
      "He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n",
      "He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n",
      "He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n",
      "He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n",
      "He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n",
      "He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n",

      "He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n",

      "Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

First off let me clarify that the map being played in this match is de_train as it is a Week 2:1 match. I will post a link to the match page below where you can follow the game live with detailed round-by-round statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**savage:** savage is relatively new to the CEVO scene, given that as a team they have only participated in the Season 5 Pro Placement Tournament (PPT) and now Season 5 CEVO-P. Since they did not play in Season 4 or any seasons prior, there will obviously be much less raw data on them. What we do know is that they are a consolidation of invite-level players, many who you will recognize from other Pro/Invite level teams, such as hades and Relyks. They were invited to participate in the CEVO PPT based off of their past invite level experience and through the tournament they were able to qualify for the Pro division, although not without some difficulty. In the Group Stages they only defeated HEAT (16-6 on de_dust2), while losing extremely close matches to SapphireKelownaDotCom (14-16 on de_mirage) and Valhalla (OT on de_inferno). They still squeaked into the double-elimination playoff bracket (BO3's), but were immediately bumped to the lower bracket after a 2-1 loss to Flaming Rainbows (now Area 51). In that particular match they lost a close game on de_dust2 and then won de_mirage (16-13) to force the tiebreaker de_train, which they lost 16-5. They bounced back though and were able to take down Mobility Gaming and Perfectionvore consecutively to secure their spot in CEVO-P. Thusfar this season they have played two matches, losing both to iBUYPOWER (2-16) and Tempo Gaming (16-19) on de_dust2. However, they were lacking Relyks against Tempo and the still pushed it to OverTime. The match tonight will be on de_train though, and as you can see above the only reference is their tiebreaker loss to Area 51 (5-16) on de_train in the PPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Homeless:** Homeless is a team very similar to savage in that they are a roster consisting of some invite-level players that qualified for the Season 5 Pro Division through the PPT. However, their roster now is very different than it was in the PPT, and as such you can't infer much at all from their past performances in that tournament. Unfortunately, there's only one other match to go off of this season and that was their loss last night to VexX Gaming on de_dust2 (13-16). They were heavily favored in that game (71-29), mostly due to the recognition of players on their roster like mosbek, frozt, and Rush. Many believe these players underperformed in that match, as the [stats](http://cevo.com/event/cs-globaloffensive/match/27417/) might indicate given their performances. However, others think it was also VexX being underestimated and extremely prepared. I think Homeless will be a difficult team to predict this season until we see more of them. They have loads of potential but it remains to be seen if it will be unleashed. Luckily for us though, this is the first match of a double-header for Homeless tonight.\n",

      "The great and powerful c0ttonnz has shown my researching skills and CS:GO knowledge to be lacking. I pushed a little deeper and found some [data on Homeless](http://play.esea.net/teams/74798?tab=league&period[type]=seasons&period[season_start]=179) from ESEA and they have an impressive record on de_train going back several seasons. (I believe I missed some info on them for CEVO as they actually participated in Season 4 but ultimately bowed out sometime during the season.) In ESEA Season 16 they were 3-0 on de_train (although one was a forfeit win) with a 16-2 win over Jitsu and 16-7 win over goLLy. Going back several seasons in ESEA the only loss I could find was to pure in Season 15 which they lost in OverTime 19-17. However, their most recent game on de_train was against tNt this week which had them barely winning 16-14. Despite that, I believe the evidence supports Homeless being well-versed on de_train, even in difficult, close matches and they're obviously preparing on it as [evidenced by their scrim activity](http://play.esea.net/teams/74798?competition=scrim).\n",

      "**Thoughts:** Given Homeless' history on de_train, especially their recent scrim activity on it, coupled with the lack of information I could find on savage, I'm inclined to lean more towards Homeless. However, I'll reiterate that their most recent game on de_train was extremely close against tNt (16-14) and Homeless seemed a little rusty in their match last night against VexX (ownage). I would still be cautious betting on this one, but then again, I'm a cautious guy. :)\n",

      "**Area 51:** This iteration of Area 51 (formerly known as Flaming Rainbows) qualified for CEVO-P this season through the Pro Placement Tournament, similar to both Homeless and savage. They finished 2-1 in the Group Stages with wins over FUIAD (16-2 on de_miragE) and Devastation (16-9 on de_inferno) and a curious FFL to Justus Pro in Round 1. However, in the playoffs they won their first BO3 against savage 2-1, winning de_dust2 in extremely close fashion, then losing a close match on de_mirage (13-16) before regrouping in a big way to win the tiebreaker de_train (16-5). They won their following match against, curiously enough, Homeless, 2-0 in maps on de_inferno (16-9) and de_train (16-10). However, the Homeless roster A51 faced in that game is entirely different now, so once again we can't infer much from those results. Thusfar this season, Area 51 has played one other match: [a 16-12 win over Reliable (formerly Mythic) on de_dust2](http://cevo.com/event/cs-globaloffensive/match/27418/). They were [heavily favored in that match though (65-35)](http://www.reddit.com/r/csgobetting/comments/2bc3du/a51_vs_reliable220714_0400_cest/) and it was a lot closer than many expected.\n",

      "  \n",
      "Looking at **Epilson**, they're performing *very* well recently. fxy0 is playing incredibly well, and their plays and moves are definitely on par with on-form top tier teams. Using a tiny bit of chain logic here, CW beat Mouse 16-11 (you should feel ashamed Na'Vi) and Epilson beat CW 16-13. This is chain logic so doesn't really show anything, but Epilson have beat CW (a team who is on good form and playing well lately, I think), which is more than Na'Vi have achieved with their losses as of late.  As this is a BO1, one of these teams could take an enormous lead early and stomp through the game. Pistol rounds are *very* important on a BO1, as there are only 2 available, and if you lose the first one it might be too late by the 2nd pistol round. HLTV's stats are putting shox as the 2nd best pistol round player based on his K/D. Na'Vi have nobody in the top 5. Watching Epilson's games lately, they're definitely a formidable team in the pistol round, as their aim has been spot on.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "*My conclusions:*  \n",
      "Epilson are performing very solidly, winning almost every game they're playing and not making many mistakes. They've performed very well vs CW, and have a strong chance of beating Na'Vi.  \n",
      "Na'Vi are underperforming and losing to teams who they should be ggez'ing. Watching the games last night, they were making mistakes that they really shouldn't have been, and a lot of shots were being missed. Na'Vi are definitely not on form, whilst I'd argue that Epilson are on top form right now, without a doubt better than Na'Vi.  \n",

Yes, every major sport is involved in some form of gambling, both legal and illegal, but I am really concerned that CS:GO and betting are becoming too symbiotic.\n",

They already blame this game for school shootings and all other forms of adolescent violence.  Do we really need the media telling the world that CS will give your child a gambling addiction as well?  There's a lot of things we as a community need to work on if we ever want to see a CS:GO player on ESPN, but I think curbing the gambling scene is a good start.  The best way to do that?

It personally seems like [Winout](http://play.esea.net/teams/90504) has some good players, but just recently formed within the past couple days while rhythm has been at it during esea playing [20 games](http://play.esea.net/teams/74735?competition=league) since july 25th and going 17-3. Not to mention their [scrims](http://play.esea.net/teams/74735?competition=scrim) have 14 wins and a tie. Although they don't play cache much, they have team chemistry and have a great awper in Assailant. More than likely Winout will not have any strats for cache, and Rhythm might have a couple if any. With the team chemistry and good skill of Rhythm, it's going to take a lot of individual carry for Winout to win....out lel. \n",

People always say d2 is their best map, but imo, they have no best map or worst map.

With Shahzam out, I personally think Denial’s Dust 2 would be shaken up, but they should still have the edge on that. Maps would probably be Inferno for Lunatik and Cache/Dust 2 for Denial, with the third random map to be Mirage or Nuke – both of which favour Denial.

      "The gigantic anti-EA circlejerk is annoying as hell but this still goes too far in the other direction. Too much blind positivity: Titanfall didn't have many maps on launch but that didn't mean any of them ended up particularly unique or noteworthy, the DLC plan will almost certainly be the same as Battlefield 3/4s with weapon/map packs that are generally ok but overpriced for what you actually get, can potentially fragment the playerbase and ultimately make the game bloated with unnecessary and imbalanced items (while there was nothing blatantly overpowered by the end, about half of Battlefield 3's guns and equipment became pointless). Some of these arguments in defence of removed features just don't make a lot of sense, 'pilotable AT-ATs would suck because noone would use them right', there's loads of ways you could work to counter this but still have them usable by players, make AT-ATs some sort of command vehicle with the option to vote the pilot out if he does badly or something, it'd be far better than just watching them linearly stomp around in any case. Red Orchestra 2 for instance has the very powerful tanks and artillery directly useable by only a very small number of players whilst everyone else is pretty much cannon fodder, but the game is designed in such a way that it (more or less) works. It's less a case of 'players won't use them right anyway' and more 'we couldn't be fucked to try and implement one of the most unique, iconic features of Star Wars in a way that players can freely utilise and have fun with'. As for mods while I don't expect any current multiplatform AAA game to support them the defence of its exclusion here it particularly weird, hacking frequently occurs with or without mod support anyway. Then there's the whole 'games cost more to make now' thing. Well yes but they also *make* a hell of a lot more, then add into that the fact that they're working on a pre-existing engine (so a good chunk of work is essentially done) and perhaps most importantly, *you don't need a hyperinflated budget* to make a good game, noone said, 'you **must** spent a metric shitting fuckload on this thing then 'support' it with overpriced DLC to make any kind of profit'.\n",

      "\n",
      "I remember a couple of times when people would just troll with the AT-AT in the first two games and not ever accomplish anything useful. A few times in Rhen Var: Harbor, they just drove it back to the imperial base and camped. Plus, they were clunky and it took ten minutes just to make it to the other end of the map, and then the process had to be repeated if it was destroyed, which was difficult, as the walker (especially on Hoth), to prevent. Overall I'm pretty indifferent to the way DICE decided to handle that as I don't see it being too game-breaking, just the phrase \"on-rails\" sounds very scary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I totally agree with the space battles thing though. They were super-fun and it was cool to raid enemy ships with transports, but that was really the highlight of it. You either be a fighter and try to shoot down other fighters -- which could be accomplished in atmospheric maps like Tatooine: Dune Sea in the first game anyways -- or you can pick a bomber and, frankly, play right-click simulator and basically spam bombs on a static object until you inevitably get shot down. Hell, I think there was only one map where the frigates actually moved. It wasn't very fun, for me at least, to just pour firepower into an object that seemed at the mercy of its fighter support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dude has a point about the space maps though. There were times when I couldn't tell if I was orbiting Yavin or Hoth until I turned around to see the planet in the skybox, and that was basically the only difference I could distinguished. It wasn't until Renegade Squadron that they started to get creative with the space map design, and by then it was too late. Even when I was like, 10, or however old I was, I still remember the huge disappoint I felt about space battles when I first played the game. I wanted the ships to move, I wanted more color in the skyboxes and more map variety. The battles were very small, and every match played out the same, even in mutliplayer. The two capitial ships didn't even shoot at each other aside from the occasional beam that lashed out at the enemy cruiser. It was all very static and bland. Only the fact that I was in SPACE(!) kept me playing it, but that wasn't always enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I miss the first game so much. Flying X-Wings and TIE-Fighters in the clouds of Bespin and over the islands of Kashyyk was FUN! It was like flying a jet in Battlefield 2 at the time. You felt powerful and fast. You could see the battle erupting beneath you and you knew that players were looking up to watch you fight. Not only that, but the planets were much more colorful than the boring sky boxes employed in the space battles in the second game. As a bomber, it was much more entertaining to see my proton bombs eradicate an AT-ST bullying my teammates, and seeing them thank me in the chat, than it was to destroy a static frigate that everyone was already after anyways. Above all, I miss Bespin: Platforms. That was just a brilliant map, and as far as I remember it was a community favorite from the old game.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I'm getting at here, is that the space battles in the second Battlefront didn't appeal to everyone. There's a pretty solid chunk of the community that stayed behind, as I did, to keep playing on maps like Naboo: Plains and Rhen Var: Harbor. (Okay Rhen Var didn't have fighters, but I think we can all agree that map was sick.) I simply think that, even though the lack of space battles is disappointing to a degree, I don't think that you should deprive yourself of the next Battlefront eleven years in the making just because they left out something from the second game that the first game did exceptionally well without.\n",

It all depends on how the movement works, which tools are at the players disposal and what the maps are like. Neither of us can tell if the 40 player count is appropriate for the game itself, but one thing I can guarante you though is that people would love a large scale star wars game, and 20v20 isn't all that large in scale.\n",

I'm personally incredibly sceptical of EA because of the way they have seemingly gimped a lot of the recent productions and released titles with fewer features at a higher cost. Much smaller studios have made much more promising titles and sold their products at a much cheaper price, look at the new sim city compared to Cities skylines, skylines is half the cost with much more freedom given to the player, and no \"games are more expensive to make\" is clearly not an excuse if you compare their products to other recent releases by other studios.

After watching the 45 minute alpha footage, I can't say I like where dice is going with this franchise. I know they keep swearing it's not, but it really does look like Star Wars battlefield, not battlefront. Hell, they should have just slapped that on the front.\n",
      "For me, Star Wars battlefront is all about a simple combat game that makes me feel like one of the unsung heroes of the movie battles. I loved feeling like I was fighting the most iconic battles of the movies. I loved holding my breath as I captured the command post needed to stop the reinforcements from bleeding out. I loved when stomach flipped every time i turned the corner to find the enemy leader there. I loved the space combat (though I seem to be the only one). I loved sprinting towards a necessary bacta tank with blaster fire whizzing by. I loved hoping in a tank to even the odds in a heavily fortified command post. I sincerely hope that this game captures some of what made the original golden, but when dice can't even allow non regenerative health into the picture, I can't really see that happening. \n",
      "Tldr: dice is just slapping the battlefront title on a game that doesn't look or feel like battlefront.\n",

Sure there will be a bunch of features missing from the original games, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game. I reckon people would have criticised the just as much even if they had included those original features. I hate EA as much as the next bloke but seems like the holy anti-battlefront sentiment is just part of the anti-EA circle jerk  \n",

It'd make more sense to have accounts, but have those accounts tied to the accounts on different retailers such as GOG and Steam rather than using them as a database for the games themselves. This would also make linking retailer accounts to multiple <insert launcher name here> accounts possible and would be the better option IMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for different retailers, I think the best way to go about this would be to have our own interface most likely done in HTML and PHP which would list games regardless of which retailer is selling them, show the lowest and highest prices and then give the user the option of which one to buy from once they are on the product page, this would also make the user interface less cluttered and fragmented in my opinion.\n",

      "The video has not been sped up, the actual animation timings in the video are a complete match with the actual game running at 60fps.\n",

      "- Arbitary framerates and/or resolutions\n",

So to fix the audio issue, you would often run the same scene two times, a high quality frame by frame rendering of the video and a low quality playback in order to capture the audio. A lot of things can go wrong here and glitchy audio running at a wrong sample rate could absolutely happen, or just good old human error.\n",
      "\n",
      "What i think happened is the following: Someone at Nvidia, Rocksteady or a third party used the \"benchmark\" command in Unreal Engine 3 along with the dumpmovie command in order to get a video that runs at a completely stable 60fps. The issue is that they then also recorded audio at the same time, resulting in them having to resample the audio incorrectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Running unoptimized code could make it hard to produce a video that is indicative of the actual performance of any game, so it's not really false advertisement as people with good enough hardware can absolutely run the game at that quality level. It would be different if the video was rendered at some insane resolution like 8k at 240 frames per second.\n",

Running the game using \"-BENCHMARK FPS=60 -DUMPMOVIE ResX=1920 ResY=1080\" does indeed force the game to render the logic at what would be a fluid 60 frames per second if run in realtime. The audio however is played back at it's original pace, recording the video using dumpmovie while locked at 60 fps using the benchmark setting while externally recording the audio, does indeed produce a result similar to what is seen in the nVidia video.\n",

I hit the desk so hard my hand still hurt 10 minutes later, but the very next try was finally successful, gold medal even, and I also beat my buddy's best time as a bonus. the game's usually more forgiving than this (like in the other problematic race, even after a crash I could finish in 3rd or 4th place), but in some cases it can be really frustrating.\n",

I finished it under 15 minutes and got bronze, and of course crashed a few times, including once about 200 meters before the finish line while I was in 4th place. luckily #3 had crashed just before me and I hit him and got back into the race at #3, otherwise it would've been 4th place and I probably wouldn't have tried it again. the race started in the afternoon and turned into night while driving, but the most atmospheric thing was probably an earlier pursuit, which started in the evening in the sunshine, but when I came out of the tunnel after a few miles, it clouded over, there was thunder and lightning, it started to get darker and the cops showed up.\n",

VP losing to Na'VI 16-12 and Kinguin losing to C9 16-7. Obviously a much better performance by VP. Virtus.Pro has a stigma for losing these kinds of games, so if you believe the golden rule then either bet on Kinguin or skip.

They are known for losing against teams they should easily beat and beating teams when they're underdog. Personally I don't think this is more true than most teams, but eh whatever. The most recent matches for VP look poor, but past 3 games ago they did very well for themselves. They recently lost 2-1 vs HR which is just not good, lost that close game to Na'Vi, and lost 2-0 vs fnatic. If we go back to the beginning of July though VP played great, winnning 6 against TSM, fnatic, C9, LG, and F3, while tying F3 and taking no losses. So other than that loss vs HellRaisers I'd say they've been playing well. Teams like mouz, dignitas, and HR always seem to challenge VP though. Since the beginning of June vs these teams VP has lost 11 maps while winning only 9. And 10 of these maps have been within 3 points. Do I have faith in VP to take this BO3, yes. I really do think they will. But this is concerning, and if VP doesn't show up and take this game 100% then an upset might happen. \n",

They also 2-0d F3 before that. Kinguin has the potential to upset here, and I think it less depends on how they play (Obviously they need to play good) and more so if their opponents play good.\n",

Honestly from here, I have no idea what it'll look like. Kinguin just doesn't have any maps they look great on or with a high win rate while VP is above 50% on every team.

The winner will be going on to face Na'Vi and I think VP really want their chance to get revenge. If this was a BO1 I'd give upset odds much higher, not simply because BO1 but because Kinguin would probably be getting a map they're okay on. But here, Kinguin will probably be stretched thin as far as their maps go. Kinguin's best maps are overpass and cache, and VP is also great on both. It's going to be a real challenge for Kinguin here to get one map, and I just don't see them getting two. Hopefully the Poles will show up and win this 2-0 as I expect to get the rematch they deserve in a BO3 vs Na'Vi.\n",

      "My question is this: How much of your fear of the potential dangers of A.I. is based around the writing of noted futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I just recently finished my Bachelor project on the validity of his [Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#Kurzweil.27s_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns), as it has not been peer reviewed but is still highly respected. I found a number of large problems with both the empiric data it was based on as well as its theoretical basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "LOAR is meant to show the unstoppable accelerating force that drives development of technology to greater and greater heights. As a basis of this, Kurzweil uses his observation that the continued [exponential growth in calculating power of computers](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/MooresLaw.jpg). Even when the technology they were using were nearing the end of its life cycle and could no longer keep up, another technology simply replaced it with no major breaks in the graph. He then goes on to generalize this to be the case for all technology, even though the only other graph that shows a similar trend across different technologies is [this one on RAM](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/ram.jpg).\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problem with this is that Kurzweil makes the mistake of believing that when each technology was beginning to have problems continuously experiencing growth, the appearance of a solution in the form of a replacement technology was inevitable. He then goes on to assume that this will always continue to happen. This is called retrospective determinism and is a logical fallacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurzweil also repeatedly states that no external force, such as politics, economy, lack of resources, technological lock-in or social circumstances can have any major effect on the continued exponential growth of technology. This is very clear technological determinism, which is also problematic, as it keeps Kurzweil from being critical of his own theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason Kurzweil gives for the continued growth, despite external forces, is (at least in some of his books and essays) that technology is actually a continuation evolution, and is therefore a fundamental aspect of the universe: a natural law. This ignores that all natural examples of exponential growth experiences diminishing returns as necessary resources become scarce. It also displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how evolution works. Kurzweil implies that technological growth is a direct continuation of human evolutionary growth. With this he is hinting that human evolution is working towards a future change. Evolution is however not a sentient, and is as such not working *towards* any specific end-goals, [unlike Kurzweil](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/CountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg).\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the empirical data is based around single sources, often websites that no longer exist. As his books have no methodology sections, the validity of the sources or how they are used is never discussed, leaving open questions of how you get a number for [calculations per second per $1000](http://www.singularity.com/charts/page70.html) for something that was never built like the Charles Babbage Analytical Engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, Kurzweils writing on the future has the effect of readers that when it touches upon their area of expertise it is obviously completely wrong, but the rest seems quite reasonable. I, myself am not an expert in artifical intelligence research, but Kurzweil is, so I could not hope to know whether his writing on that subject is more valid than his books on the singularity, but I assume so. Just be aware that years of living from innovation might have made Kurzweil too uncritical of his own theories.\n",

      "The American Civil War, widely known in the United States as simply the Civil War as well as other sectional names, was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 to determine the survival of the Union or independence for the Confederacy. Among the 34 states in January 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy, often simply called the South, grew to include eleven states, and although they claimed thirteen states and additional western territories, the Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by a foreign country. The states that remained loyal and did not declare secession were known as the Union or the North. The war had its origin in the fractious issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. After four years of combat, which left over 600,000 Union and Confederate soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed and slavery was abolished. Then began the Reconstruction and the processes of restoring national unity and guaranteeing civil rights to the freed slaves.\n",
      "In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, supported banning slavery in all the U.S. territories, something the Southern states viewed as a violation of their constitutional rights and as being part of a plan to eventually abolish slavery. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a majority of the electoral votes, and Lincoln was elected the first Republican president, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven slave states with cotton-based economies formed the Confederacy. The first six to secede had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 48.8% for the six. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. Efforts at compromise failed, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on \"King Cotton\" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.\n",
      "Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for every state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The first bloodshed of the Civil War occurred in Maryland during the Baltimore riot of 1861 on April 19. Lincoln soon controlled the border states, after arresting state legislators and suspending habeas corpus, ignoring the ruling of the Supreme Court's Chief Justice that such suspension was unconstitutional, and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland  ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a war goal.\n",
      "Causes of secession  \n",
      "The causes of the Civil War were complex and have been controversial since the war began. James C. Bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated by historical revisionists, who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war. Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s. The Republican Party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, Lincoln, won the 1860 election. After Lincoln had won without carrying a single Southern state, many Southern whites felt that disunion had become their only option, because they thought that they were losing representation, which would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.\n",

Most are perfectly aware that bias and profiling of this manner is wrong, that's the abstract portion of our mind, but the more primal recesses of the brain will default to an immediate, unconscious bias. That's why you will still see a bleeding heart city liberal move to the other side of the walk when passing a black person at night, or refuse to live in the heart of a crime-ridden neighborhood. It's important to be aware of, and respond to appropriately.\n",

In a weird way, I felt like the black community wasn't giving the police a chance to avoid judgement either. At this weird intersection of mutual distrust you are not going to find common ground. At this rate, the police will always back their boys, and so will the blacks, regardless of justification, and until this hivemind is dissipated it will be two strongly cohesive units butting heads.\n",

In my area there is a single psychiatrist that medi-cal patients can go to for meds. The wait to have a video conference with that doctor is nearly 5 months.  It is truly an uphill battle to get help. Then, once you have meds prescribed to you, the local doctor, who does the refills, can take you of of them.  This happened to a family friend.  She is now off her meds because the regular clinic doctor decided she didn't need one of the meds the psychiatrist prescribed, and also cut the dosage of the other.    I'm crushed because the meds were really working well for her and now she is back to square one. It's terrible and I worry about my friend.

Also, psychiatrists I talk to seem pretty happy with their pay, by and large.  We aren't a group that is particularly money driven.  I'm not sure if that's cause or effect.

It's so bad that I'll prescribe a patient something off the Walmart $4 list and get them to go there and NOT use their insurance, because the insurance will just refuse to pay for it.  $4!

Unfortunately, it also means that if you don't have cash, you don't get seen.

Like he didn't shout but you could hear it no matter what. So one of them pulled a coconut knife and tried to swing it at him. I didn't even see him move but he simply snatched it out of the guy's hand while it was swinging. He didn't try to protect his face. \n",

      "\n",
      "In highschool, we had a few of us guys start an online forum of upper-classmen/nerds. We developed a rivalry of lower classmen, whom had their own online forum. Our rivalry ran deep and nerd ego's flew. We decided to end our rivalry by way of Lan Party. For months, we plotted, infiltrated each others forums, practiced game-plans, and engaged in forum espionage. It got a little nasty. Eventually, we parlayed and set some ground rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rule 1, no more forum espionage. The rest were as follows:\n",
      "Once the logistics of the LAN were set in place, our format consisted of: \n",
      "\n",
      "Round 1 (Opponents Choice of game): Team Fortress Classic (TFC)\n",
      "Best of 3 matches. 5 man teams. \n",
      "\n",
      "Round 2 (Our choice of game): Total Annihilation 1.3(TA)\n",

      "Round 3 (Both team's Choice of game): Counter Strike: 1.6 (CS)\n",
      "Best of 3 maps, 5 man teams, league rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "As preparation, we didn't even bother practicing Team Fortress Classic. None of our team played it, and we couldn't compete with their 5+ years of playing TFC. We were planning on just letting them have that round. We practiced some Total Annihilation, but we knew they didn't have a chance at beating us. So it came down to practicing for CS. Weeks of planning, and practicing went by and we came to the conclusion that we were really playing against 2 key players. One with equal skills to our best players, and one with mediocre skills. Our team had 4 out of 5 people that played pretty competitively. \n",
      "\n",
      "The night of the LAN came, and we had about 4 hours of setup time with people trickling in. After a McDonald's run, and tripping the breaker twice, we had 29 computers setup in a friends basement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rounds 1 and 2 went as planned. They won two games of TFC in a landslide, and we won 2 games of TA in a total of 19 mins. For anyone who has played TA, they should know that any decently matched game should take over 30-45 mins per game.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Round 3 came down to the wire. We played 3 maps, both sides at 15 rounds each. de_dust, de_aztec, and the Final round to be chosen by the team who won a coin toss. They won the first set on dust, and we won the second set. We won the two sets of aztec. So we were up 3-1 going into the final round. We won the coin toss and chose de_inferno. We had to win the first set of 15 rounds. Each team won 7 rounds each in the first set. So it came down to the last round. If we were to win, this round, they couldn't come back and tie it up for a sudden death round. Both teams were eliminated down to 1 vs 1. It was myself, and their best player. Looking at the console logs, That 1vs1 started with each player being hit at least once. The firefight lasted just a few moments in the A site of Inferno around the central boxes, but it felt longer. I had used my last burst of 5 rounds in my M4 to kill my enemy and put the final nail in the coffin of the lan. My cousin, on our team, took MVP for highest KD ratio.\n",

After that his wounds were smeared with honey and a goat was brought to lick the honey off his skin with his rough tongue. The goat however refused to touch the body of the sentenced. After this and other tortures he was left to pass the night with his hands and feet bound together, like a ball, so sleep would be difficult. During the following three days, he was repeatedly mocked and hung on a pole with his hands tied behind his back. Then a weight of 300 metric pounds (150 kg) was attached to each of his big toes for half an hour. After this half hour Gérard was fitted with shoes made of well-oiled, uncured dog skin; the shoes were two fingers shorter than his feet. In this state he was put before a fire. When the shoes warmed up, they contracted, crushing the feet inside them to stumps. When the shoes were removed, his half-broiled skin was torn off. After his feet were damaged, his armpits were branded. After that he was dressed in a shirt soaked in alcohol. Then burning bacon fat was poured over him and sharp nails were stuck between the flesh and the nails of his hands and feet. Gérard is said to have remained calm during his torture. On 14 July 1584, Gérard was executed.\n",

Also, while most of the series is boring \"political intrigue\" when it comes to plot, that's only half of this one.

      "There are no punishments that will actually deter a student from doing anything. Further, I cannot exclude students from my classroom, at least not long enough to make a difference.

      "A secondary question/problem comes from identifying bullying. With the national attention bullying has received there are cases of students claiming bullying frivolously to get someone in trouble or as \"a joke\".

Of course, by then my hands are tied; a student reported bullying and I must report it. \n",

      "To be clear, I agree: We must do something about the problem. Punishments in schools are often trivial (at least in the minds of those receiving them).

I just think it's time we stop calling for *someone* to do *something* and start having a serious discussion about **who** should be taking **what** concrete actions that will be effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I'd like to point out, that students harassing and bullying *teachers* in classrooms is also a problem. When I have a kid engaging in these behaviors I have no real recourse against them, either. I had one student at the end of the 2014-2015 year who was really terrible to me. It was interfering with my ability to manage the room and teach. His parents were unresponsive - they never answered my efforts to contact them. After a particularly abusive class period (which left even his peers stunned speechless!) I told him that he was unwelcome in my classroom until he apologized and changed his ways. After a few days of the child spending the period in in-school suspension, the vice principal called me up and told me that there was nothing that we could do and I had to allow him back into my classroom. They couldn't/wouldn't(?) even switch him to a different teacher. This story ends well, at least. With the student back in the classroom, his peers were model students (many of them made a point to apologize for him and for any behaviors of their own over the year). I stood my ground, demanding he behave respectfully and refusing to take his bait or sink to his level. After a few days he came around, apologized, started participating, and we finished the school year in a good place. But this wouldn't be effective against someone bullying a fellow student and I still had to put up with a torrent of abuse in the mean time. \n",

      "Hospice worker here. This is standard procedure. Hospice is for people who are expected to live 6 more months or less and for whom there is either no treatment, or they decide not to seek treatment. As such, people brought onto hospice are supposed to be dying very soon. Sometimes, people come on and their symptoms are suddenly managed better, they are more comfortable, they're uplifted by spiritual care... and they start to get better. It's good, sort of, but if their prognosis is getting better, we can't really justify giving them care intended for the dying, and insurance companies sure as shit won't pay for that.\n",

      "Years ago, there was a lot of abuse in the system--people being kept on hospice for YEARS without declining at all. Current laws say they must be recertified twice in the first 6 months, then every 2 months after that to be certain that they are hospice appropriate. This cuts back on hospices taking money for patients who they shouldn't even be taking care of due to the non-severity of their illness. What's more, she can always reapply. If her symptoms get worse, she gets closer to passing, etc. she would likely be taken right back on. But if she's on for two years, you have to realize that it doesn't make sense to continue care for her and, if we did, that would be money out of your pocket to give someone inappropriate medical care.\n",

      "Palliative care is not synonymous with hospice. Hospice is a Medicare benefit, and there are certain criteria that has to be met in order to qualify in the first place. Just because you are old or \"ready to die\" does not automatically qualify you. You must have an end-stage condition/terminal diagnosis to apply, meaning that it is not surprising if you pass away within the next 6 months. However, you do not automatically get kicked off simply because you hit that mark. I have taken care of people who have lived over a year on hospice because they still meet criteria. As /u/f30er had mentioned, hospice teams meet every so often to discuss re-certification, and a \"face to face\" is conducted every few months. I cannot speak for every hospice organization, but for myself, I hate discharging patients off of hospice--especially when patients and families really are benefiting from the services. Some diagnoses such as Alzheimers can be difficult to keep patient's on if they do not have continued weight loss, recurrent infections, or great amount of symptom management needs and have been stable in regard to functional status. But unfortunately, there are set guidelines to keeping patients on the service, as Medicare pays for all of the services, equipment, and medications while on hospice (with exceptions, such as room and board at a facility). And as with other government-funded assistance programs, there will always be the few bad apples that abuse the benefit. I experienced instances where patients lie about how much pain they are in and sell their pain pills for extra money, or family members caught stealing all of grandma's opiates to use for themselves. Does not mean that those patients do not qualify, but I do feel for all those who are paying for someone else's greed. Also, if we keep people on who do not qualify, we as recertifiers can be at risk for being audited. Hospice in itself is not for everyone. People and families need to ask themselves if they are ready to give up things like hospitalizations, chemo/radiation, surgeries, even basic things like IV fluids and IV medications. This can be a very hard decision, especially giving up interventions such as dialysis, where we know it would set a much more definitive time someone would have left to live. But just like how people can graduate off of hospice, people have the right to revoke hospice and return back to traditional medicine. Oftentimes, people do not access their hospice benefit until they are at their last moments of life, but instead of focusing on suffering and death, I would hope that hospice could instead help patient's control their symptoms so that they can enjoy their life for however much time they do have left. Nothing makes me happier than to talk with families about how their loved ones had one more chance to go outside and play with their pets, or a patient who almost passes away from a serious pneumonia is now up, walking, and smiling again.\n",

The Hospice team is so overwhelmingly wonderful and becomes a part of ones support system. Losing them, even for a short period of time, is quite a blow to the morale of the patient and family. In my experience Hospice provided such great care that my Mom got better for a time (resulting in discharge)  because she was able to receive help in ways she couldn't otherwise. Generally people forget how isolated and stressed these families are because most of their time is spent managing symptoms, doctors appointments, and saying goodbyes. The patient and family are typically isolated with Hospice as one of the only 'lifeboats' they have left.

The cocaine-free leaves are sold to The Coca Cola Company, while the cocaine is sold to Mallinckrodt, a pharmaceutical firm, for medicinal purposes.[4]\n",

Most of them are nightmares, however, where I'm being chased by some type of monster or serial killer but halfway through the dream I become sentient and then strangle whatever's chasing me with my mind so I can be left alone. Then I take the corpse of the monster and I make it edible with my mind and then I eat it in front of other monsters and nightmares as a warning not to fuck with me.

      "Not all of them end well, however. This one I had a few days ago and it was kinda scary and it involves rape which freaks me out. For some reason I was this really attractive Spanish girl who was 17-19 years old, had a younger sister and I lived in Columbia (I think it was Columbia, but it was some South American country). The dream was basically a PSA from the government to American tourists to be careful while traveling. But anyway, I was this Spanish girl and I was hanging with my group of friends and there was always this one dude we found creepy in our group but nobody really talked to him. He just fiddled around on his phone or whatever. Everyone else got along really well. One day while everyone else was out running errands I went to our usual spot where we hung out and it was just him. And I asked where everyone was and he said they were busy, and then I said oh that's cool just tell them we should all hang out later and then he starts getting really flirty and creepy and I was like ehhh back off, dude. And then he started getting angry and saying that I liked some other dude in the group and that I'd never give him a chance and I was like what the fuck man it's platonic I don't date friends. And then he starts calling me a bitch, slut and whore and all so I'm about to leave and then I notice his cousin was hiding behind a pillar with a bat and so I tried to run but they both chased me and eventually caught me right in front of everyone in broad daylight and then dragged me to an alley and beat me and raped me (this is all a dream btw, I'm perfectly fine!). There were plenty of witnesses, but nobody cared. \n",

Then I spent the next 10 years as a human slave for the cartel and had several children that were also sold off and along the way I encountered so many different customers who were mostly wealthy westerners, a few other crime lords, and occasionally other girls who were also crime lords or madams.\n",

Then my story got out to reporters and they turned it into a film called 'Body' and it was a Hollywood thriller that was financed by the Colombian government to stop human trafficking and to warn tourists of the dangers of the cartel.\n",

Somehow the bears got in and they were clawing up the bathroom door so we had to go out of the window. Since we were on the second floor we decided to go up to the ridge of the roof and sit on it so we would be safe.

Then these three giant dogs come round the corner behind us. I scream, she hops over the fence and helps me up. Somehow, one of the dogs gets onto the little ledge and we're surrounded. I jump down, past the dogs, and try to run down the road to get help. All of them follow me. I start getting flashes of what will happen if they get us - imagine a to-do with the arms and legs bitten off, covered in blood, exposed muscle. That sort of thing. I decide the only thing to do is jump off the cliff and hopefully they'll follow me. I'm standing on the edge, they're all coming straight for me, and I throw myself over the side.

There's a giant eel in the lake. Its coiled-up body fills the whole space. And it's dead. Its skin is coming off in huge sheets and the water is so full of slime it's more like syrup.

      "\n",
      "Briefly stated, the Pueblos were not a united nation, but rather a collection of sedentary, maize-based agriculturalists from several linguistic families. After contact and the establishment of missions an uneasy truce existed between the Spanish and the Pueblos. The suppression of religious ceremonies, the torture and murder of pueblo priests, combined with food scarcity from a prolonged drought and excess mortality from Apache raids caused tensions to overflow. From his hideout in Taos Pueblo a spiritual leader named Po'pay sent runners to the other pueblos with plans for revolt. Some, like Isleta Pueblo, decided to ally with the Spanish, but most of the Pueblos united to drive the Spanish from New Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revolt shocked the Empire. It rolled back the frontier at a time when Spain feared the growing encroachment of France and England, the example of a successful revolt threatened the tenuous stability of other frontier missions in Texas and Arizona, and the lucrative mines of Northern Mexico were now perilously close to the northern edge of the Empire. When de Vargas led his \"bloodless\" reconquest twelve years later the nature of Spanish-Pueblo relations changed to avoid the same oppression that fueled the revolt.\n",

      "While this was a huge blow to the Soviet Union, the long-term effects proved murderous for the Second Polish Republic. An identity crisis ensued as newborn Poland was unsure whether to become a nation-state, like Germany to its west, or to become a multiethnic nation, like the Soviets to the east. Its demographics lay directly between the two attitudes, both in numbers and in political views. Political instability defines Poland between 1920 and 1939; this shaky situation would create a weak, ineffectual Polish state which would soon be preyed upon by Nazi Germany.\n",

      "The first idea is Americanism. Mustangs make great-looking symbols of our country's pride.

      "\n",
      "The second idea is that charismatic animals are \"better\" than others. More human, somehow. Pigs and dogs have about the same intelligence, but dogs are cuter, somewhat more obedient, and fluffier, so we eat the pigs and let the dogs sleep in our beds. Horses are only a little smarter than cows, and less intelligent than either pigs *or* dogs, but they are very pretty. So we give them special status.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third idea is one of pure fantasy, the idea that horses are something they are not. Horses are some of the most anthropomorphousized animals in history (see My Little Pony, Black Beauty, Trigger, Mr. Ed, every Disney horse, Barbie horses, etc etc). We attribute motives and higher level emotions to them that just aren't there. Sometimes in media, horses even act like dogs (see: Tangled) when their typical behavior is much more similar to that of deer. *Unlike* dogs, a horse's first instinct is flight. Not loyalty to the pack, not defense, not curiosity, but run-the-fuck-away. Every single movie/cartoon where a horse bravely defends his master, or otherwise shows great empathy, is pretty much a lie. Horses will help their young (up to a certain age), and there's the occasional story of a remarkable bond between a horse and a human, but most of the time... Most of the time, a horse does not truly care about you, me, or anybody else. A horse responds positively to training, routine, food rewards, routine, leadership, routine, and again, routine. But should anything change, or become alarming, a horse's first instinct is always run-the-fuck-away. A dog will die for you unquestioningly. A pig will miss you. A horse will step on your dead body to get to a bucket of grain, and then run the fuck away when your keys fall noisily out of your pocket. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's not their fault, but horses are *not* great pets. I have been injured by some really lovely horses. Horses that would nuzzle my ear, give me \"hugs,\" gallop beautifully down the trail for me, horses that begged for belly scratches. I have been bucked off, landed on, bitten, and hospitalized for days by horses. They are wonderful, but they are also 1,000lb prey animals with brains the size of walnuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "So take a moment and set aside your preconceived notions.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you read articles like the one posted here, try to mentally substitute the word \"horse\" with just about any other large prey animal. (Actually, a good comparison would be the feral pigs in the South. Mustangs are much prettier, but only slightly less destructive, and much more dumb.) \n",
      "\n",
      "If you do this, the article would read:\n",
      "\n",
      "The US government votes to slaughter 45,000 [prey animals we could eat] to make room for [different prey animals we prefer to eat].\n",
      "\n",
      "And before the neigh-sayers jump down my throat, no, I am not saying that horse slaughter and cow slaughter are quite the same thing. As I said before, horses are much more like deer, so the process of slaughter is more stressful for them. (We have neatly \"solved\" this ethical problem in the US by defunding horse slaughter plant inspections, resulting in thousands of horses per year being shipped thousands of miles to Mexican and Canadian horse slaughter plants, often in cramped trailers with no food or water.)\n",
      "\n",
      "What I *am* saying though, is let's be a little more rational about this, shall we?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most **irrational** things about this debate is this:\n",
      "If you are one of those people who consider horses to be highly intelligent, empathetic, nearly magical animals... why are you OK with leaving them \"wild\" out on the range? Surely you wouldn't let your DOG fend for himself in the wild, right? Mustangs are hit by cars, lose ears to frostbite, get pregnant before they are physically mature, and suffer from inbreeding, dehydration, parasites, and untreated injuries. They also suffer quite a bit from malnutrition,  because they require so many calories for their big bodies, especially during cold weather. True \"wild horses\" are smaller, able to process poor forage more efficiently, and generally live in grassland habitats, not the desert. Mustangs, feral mutts that they are, have a harder time surviving. Poor things.\n",
      "\n",
      "So is it really in the mustangs' best interests to be \"free\" anyway? I propose no, it's not. If you would be against your domestic horsie Mr. Sparkles being turned loose to fend for himself, you should not be *for* \"wild\" mustangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BLM (Bureau of Land Management) has attempted to diplomatically solve this whole problem by allowing some mustang herds to roam free, sterilizing some with chemical darts, and rounding some up for adoption. Seems like a good compromise, right? Unfortunately, people who are in love with \"mystical mustangs\" HATE the idea of ANY roundups or sterilization. Also unfortunately, few people are willing to adopt thousands of mustangs every year, despite extremely low fees and adoption requirements. Add to this the fact that the BLM is way underfunded, and that's how you get to the current situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to help, here's how:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Adopt a mustang. Every other month or so, there's an online auction of government-captured mustangs here: https://www.blm.gov/adoptahorse/onlinegallery.php\n",
      "The minimum bid is only $125. You do need to be \"approved\" to bid, but it involves only about half the paperwork of doing your taxes. The BLM will even deliver your horse to a location near(ish) you. And because mustangs are descended from every kind of horse ever escaped or left to run wild, they can be every color, shape, gait, and temperament, you have so many choices!\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Support petitions that make slaughter (of ANY animal) more humane.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Join the Meatless Mondays movement. Raising animals for meat  (in small, tightly packed places or on factory farms) is inhumane, has a HUGELY negative impact on our environment, and it can also have a terrible impact on human health. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Support your local small farmer, and take your kids to farms! Let's promote a healthy, humane style of farming, and let's show future generations where their food really comes from so that they learn to value it.\n",

      "1. The base line for the leaks, ok so the CIA is a spy agency that can hack into foreign governments and hack into smart devices, woop-de-doo. You expect me to act surprised? It only confirmed Snowden's leaks. Oh and by the way, [WIRED even hacked some guy's smart car on the freeway](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) so if they can do that I'm pretty fucking sure the CIA could as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The timing of the leaks, when Wikileaks released these documents Jeff Sessions and Michael Flynn and all of Trump's ties to Russia were in the news. Russia came back up and Wikileaks jumps on to try to change the subject. That timing is way too fucking suspicious and with their involvement of the email scandals of John Podesta and the DNC in the election hurts their credibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. And finally, their credibility. Wikileaks' emails on John Podesta helped spark the infamous \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory which [they themselves have tweeted about](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/821595404500430848) so they support it, which [Michael Flynn's son has tweeted about in support of](https://twitter.com/mflynnjr/status/839877413660147713) and which lead to the conspiracy theorist [firing shots at the Comet Ping Pong shop.](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Comet-Ping-Pong-Shooter-Indicted-on-Gun-Charges-406890795.html) Luckily no one was hurt but Wikileaks would've had blood on its hands. Plus they themselves have perpetuated conspiracy theory nonsense including the false notion that Hillary was going to be arrested through the Anthony Wiener revelation [with their source being fucking Breitbart](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794691433068367872) so excuse me if I don't trust someone who uses White Nationalist propaganda sites.\n",

      "The song \"Watch Me Whip\" is single-handedly the worst song I have ever heard. Before you get all bent out of shape, I do know that it's not to be some intellectual masterpiece of modern art; it is just factually a shitty song. Here's why:\n",
      "Repetition:\n",
      "This song takes repetition to a level rivaled only by songs written for 3 year-olds. The singer repeats his name a full 6 times before the third verse, just in case you were wondering who 'wrote'? No vocalised the script put in front of him.\n",
      "There were 980 'words' in this song. Is nae a word? Scratch that, I truly don’t care. Of those 980 words, three variations (Now watch, now watch me, watch me) represent 369 words. That’s more than ⅓ of the song for literally 3 words (and I didn’t include the single mentions of the word ‘me’). If we include ‘ooh’ (there are 84 instances) and ‘bop’ (there are 72 instances), which total 156, we have 525 out of 980 words made up of 5 words.\n",
      "I think we get the picture on this.\n",
      "Simplicity:\n",
      "The most complex word in this song is a tie between ‘Silento’, the vocalist’s (not an artist in my opinion) handle, the word ‘already’ (which appears literally once), and the word ‘superman’. Doing a quick tally, that means that 15 single word instances are 3 syllables. All the rest are 1 or 2 syllables. The vocabulary is not strong with this one. Look at that! My use of ‘vocabulary’ beat out this song by 2 whole syllables!\n",
      "The culmination of the two previous points into the dumbing down of everyone who had the displeasure of hearing this song:\n",
      "Pretty self-explanatory. Look, I get that the writer wasn’t going for a Pulitzer or a Grammy, but a quick hit that’ll be catchy and easy to remember. Fair enough. EXCEPT FUCK YOU YOU’RE LITERALLY RUINING MUSIC. Who am I to say what should and shouldn’t be written? An asshole, that’s who. One who is procrastinating other, important work.\n",
      "Basically, by putting music out that has a grand total of about 30 unique words, you’re contributing to the lowered standard of quality of music. This is one step away from repeating one single word over and over for 5 minutes straight, which now that I think about it probably exists. Except that would have some comedic value at the very least. This shit, well it’s like a kindergartener took a crayon and drew a stickman (poorly, I might add), that was subsequently put up in an art gallery. Real, impressionable children will listen to this and think “ Wow, dad was wrong! I CAN skate in life only knowing less than the bare minimum needed to be able to read ‘See Spot Run’, which I never did because fuck books and education”. (Side note - That interaction wouldn’t have been possible outside the child’s head, since there are too many unique words used)\n",
      "Now put on your tin-foil hats, because this is where I lose half of you with my bullshit. Songs like this promote the opposite of education. Like I said, it devalues a halfway competent vocabulary in the name of catchiness and a cheap ‘musical’ fix. When you see what can be presumably defined as success (ie having several hundred million views on Youtube and countless other radio plays), it sets a standard in young, impressionable minds. We’ve had many people trying to get past this dumbing down of society, like KRS-ONE, Stevie Wonder, John Lennon, and many others (No, of course not all of their songs). They were trying to create a more engaged people who reflect on the actual issues we face as a society, instead of making up a cute little dance to go along with your shitty track as your brain melts from lack of use.\n",
      "Who is the target market for this song? For all the reasons I’ve brought forth, I believe the target market to be the typical vapid, vacuous consumer that doesn’t engage in critical thought related to anything more than whether the Kardashians look better in blue or teal. I realise that I’ve made a broad, fairly baseless claim, and yet I’m confident it’s pretty accurate.\n",
      "Songs like these placate the masses with their simplicity and safety. You don’t need to think, you don’t need to guess what it’s talking about, you just need to follow these three easy steps and you too can conform to the newest dance craze. Independent thought is the antithesis of this track. By listening to this, you are using time that could be spent thinking of ways to better the city/country/world you live in. Again, I realise that not everyone WANTS to engage with the world like this, but I will still stand by the claim that critical thought is better than being herded like a goddamn sheep by pop-music.\n",
      "So what have we learned today? Well, mostly that I’m way too mad about a song. That’s a given. What I want to really stress is that this song is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand. Like the CIA funneling crack into ghettos, to me this type of music represents a concerted effort to quell independent thought. Ultimately it’s easier to listen to a catchy song with like 7 words than to actually sit back and think about why everything is kind of messed up.\n",

War is poison, the Western Countries wanted to break the little but thriving country named Yugoslavia. It was a communist regime and did not fit Europe's or American government because it could not be controlled. It had no debt owed to anyone, so Croatia was promised a place in the Union to break ties with Serbia. I have family on all three sides and I do not want to choose any but war brought pain on all three. We can point fingers to the Serbs but we were puppets in this power struggle of who gets to control this planet. It looks to me that Europe is losing its control over it's own territory as countries within are dividing. Innocent civilians are caught in the middle of all these wars and are forced to fight against each other. Unfortunately, the bad people in the war create horrific tragedies that are hard to separate in our minds from a person race, nationality or origin.

I don't think I fully appreciated either a) what kind of life that kind of money could have enabled for me or b) what kind of commitment I'd have been really taking on to access it, but I've never regretted the decision. However, it's something which has shaped me: I know that there are things that are more important than money. I know what I'm *not* willing to do to be rich. I've managed to do pretty well for myself on my own, and feel like I've earned my success... which has always been important to me.

      "Oh, not even a throw away on this one. I grew up in the Midwest in a factory town where all the factories were leaving. We lived in government housing after losing our house and that was that. Low grade racism was everywhere, homophobia as well. A lot of it was far subtler then you think. It wasn't all \"let’s set the gays on fire\" or \"kill the queers\" or anything like that. It was \"man up\", \"don't be a girl\", calling boys by girls names if they complained. This was before the 90s when \"gay\" turned into a insult all its own in common use, at least near us. Threatening to put a boy into a dress was grounds for a physical altercation. \n",

      "\n",
      "This stuck with me, even after I left that place. Especially the pedophile part. It was something that I truly believed and having had experience with child abusers, was something I abhorred. I know people have a very hard time with understanding \"how can someone hate like that\" or \"how can they be so ignorant!”. But I can tell you from personal experience, its far easier than you think. Everyone you know is taught this, everyone you respect and love and trust are telling you this. It’s very powerful on a level that I can't really express if you have not experienced it. \n",

      "Now to the crux the matter, how did I change my opinion. In short, the answer is people who cared enough to help me change. Exposure to gay people, watching loved ones sexually mature in to gay, bi, and several mixes of pansexual helped. But it really was the people who took the time, that humanized them, people who ware insanely patient with me, that firmly told me I was wrong but didn’t dismiss me out right for it and showed me there was another way. Now most of my friends and loved ones are LGBT and I try to be an advocate for them. You cannot teach someone how to see someone else’s humanity with insults, with derision, with anger or with hate. You will not change their opinions by mocking them, insulting their families, or ridiculing all they have known. Exposure, patience, leading by example, constantly firmly teaching in small ways if you can, and most importantly empathy will get it done if it can be. \n",

      "Empathy is critical here, I cannot stress this enough nothing will stymie your efforts faster than dismissing them as an ignorant hick/redneck/racist/etc. It really makes a difference, view it from that point of view, you have someone telling you up is down that is counter to your prior experience, that has always just simply been that way AND they are insulting you the whole time. What are the odds you are going to listen to them? This is hard work, and honestly it should not be up to the people being directly impacted to be the advocates. No one should ever have to justify their humanity to someone who does not want to accept it. This is an issue the straight community needs to address and advocate and teach much more strongly than we do. I have the discussions now so that my loved ones don’t have to.

      "Was fully expecting HODL to be the entire thread lol, which it kinda is, but with strategy. It seems to me like your transferring security investment advice to crypto here, which is not dumb. However, I would argue it’s still to soon for this kind of strategy, again I’m not saying it’s a bad one, and your guide is pretty broad so it allows for variants which is good. But the reason I think it’s too soon is because a large amount of the market is still pretty much tied to bitcoin and you can make larger profits by trading the swings (this falls under the a higher risk tolerant strategy). So, while the 5-10% gain outlook your describing is reasonable (and a good outlook to keep yourself grounded), there is a lot of money to be made off volatility, which I don’t see leaving for quite some time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Having actually read through both documents—as should the rest of you—the tone of the CFTC and the SEC are notably different, and not unilaterally \"positive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The CFTC is basically pretty optimistic and emphasizes the potential of blockchain tech to revolutionize industry (offering examples of the benefits to the financial industry in particular). However, Giancarlo's testimony also includes the following line under the heading of \"Policy considerations\" (emphasis mine): \n",
      "> “Do no harm” was unquestionably the right approach to development of the Internet. Similarly, I believe that “do no harm” is the right overarching approach for distributed ledger technology. **Virtual currencies, however, likely require more attentive regulatory oversight in key areas, especially to the extent that retail investors are attracted to this space.**\"\n",

      "If we look at the SEC's position, unlike the CFTC, they are clearly unhappy with the current ICO situation, and the way certain cryptocurrencies that are clearly securities have attempted to position themselves as anything but in order to evade regulation. Consider the following quotes, again, emphasis mine:\n",
      "> \"While there are cryptocurrencies that, at least as currently designed, promoted and used, do not appear to be securities, **simply calling something a “currency” or a currency-based product does not mean that it is not a security.** To this point I would note that many products labeled as cryptocurrencies or related assets are increasingly being promoted as investment opportunities that rely on the efforts of others, with their utility as an efficient medium for commercial exchange being a distinct secondary characteristic. As discussed in more detail below, **if a cryptocurrency, or a product with its value tied to one or more cryptocurrencies, is a security, its promoters cannot make offers or sales unless they comply with the registration and other requirements under our federal securities laws.**\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"A key question all ICO market participants – promoters, sellers, lawyers, officers and directors and accountants, as well as investors – should ask: “Is the coin or token a security?” As securities law practitioners know well, the answer depends on the facts. But **by and large, the structures of ICOs that I have seen involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions of our federal securities laws.**\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"**Merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security.** Tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law. It is especially troubling when the promoters of these offerings emphasize the secondary market trading potential of these tokens, i.e., the ability to sell them on an exchange at a profit. **In short, prospective purchasers are being sold on the potential for tokens to increase in value – with the ability to lock in those increases by reselling the tokens on a secondary market – or to otherwise profit from the tokens based on the efforts of others. These are key hallmarks of a security and a securities offering.**\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC is clearly upset that so many cryptos are taking steps to avoid regulation, and I would fully expect them to come down hard on these. I imagine it is with this expectation that Bittrex, a US-based exchange, has taken careful steps with a particular crypto (that I will not name) to prevent dividend generation, thus sidestepping its classification as a security.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, I would say it's a positive look for cryptocurrency as a whole. However, it must be noted that this depends on your particular attitude toward crypto: there are many stakeholders in this space, and people have different opinions. If you dislike government regulation and want them keeping their hands off, then sorry, this is bad news for you—the US government clearly plans to get *more* involved, not less. On the other hand, if you want the technology and the market as a whole to succeed in the long-run, then this is good news. As much as certain demographics in the community may despise \"whales\" and \"Wall Street\", we must all acknowledge that the scale of institutional investment is orders of magnitude anything larger than we've seen yet; indeed, the CFTC testimony begins with a remark that the total market cap of Bitcoin is less than McDonalds alone. Thus, if the crypto market is to REALLY take off, we need institutional investors, and the reality is that they need regulatory guarantees if they are to enter the market. They are investing others' money, and they need guarantees of stability and security in order to answer to the concerns of their shareholders. Increased regulation is a step in that direction.\n",

Only make the obvious moves. Even in a bear market nothing goes down constantly without short temporary upswings at least.

Then you start DCAing and wait for the rebound. \n",

      "One of the user experience gains of the 1.4 is the possibility to install much more apps on the Nano S. The global limitation is related to the small amount of memory available on the device. The new firmware doesn't expand the memory, but optimizes the size of Bitcoin related apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many cryptocurrency projects are clones of the Bitcoin blockchain and therefore share most of the signature code (such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Zcash, Komodo, Stratis, Posw, Pivx, Viacoin, Vertcoin, Stealthcoin, Digibyte, Qtum, Hcash...). By refactoring all common codes in a library (hosted in the Bitcoin app), we were able to significantly lower the size of the other apps. On this principle, it is possible to install up to 18 apps sharing this library.\n",

      "But if you install apps with a completely different code base (for instance: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, FIDO U2F, Password Manager) you'll still be limited to 4 or 5 apps.\n",

      "Tip: when the dashboard has many apps (> 10), the device will freeze for a few seconds just after entering the PIN. This is due to the time necessary to sort the apps to display.

      "I would start by fixing the healthcare system and the public education system. I think trying out free healthcare would be beneficial, and if it was too much of a burden on taxpayers i'd obviously stop. everything's worth a try. I'd also try to give more money to teachers and public schools so they can expand in areas of learning. Teachers should have unlimited access to books, paper, pencils, and any other supplied they need. They're basically prepping the new generation of adults for life. I'd focus greatly on inner city schools. I would also try to make peace with everyone, i'd pull our troops back from the US bases in other countries. Other countries don't have military bases here, so why should we have them there? I would make sure we stop being the world police. I'd make weed legal and release anyone with a weed related drug charge from prison/jail and clear if off their record. I would also like to propose stricter gun laws like making the legal age 21, making it mandatory to take a safety course and training course before you can get a license to own a gun. I would make abortion easier to get as well. Tax funded women's clinics should be in every city. The taxes would not go towards abortion, but towards free health care such as mammograms, birth control, ultrasounds, pap smears, etc. Abortions would still be paid out of pocket, but would be more available. They MUST be available. Denying someone healthcare should not be ok. Maybe i'd make a law that protesters cannot be within a 10 yard radius of the clinics property in order to protect patients from being harassed. Sorry if this is a lot, i'm high and on a roooollll. I have a lot of thoughts on what they president should be doing, instead of what he is doing.\n",

      "People make fun of the flying spaghetti monster argument but it's pretty sound to me. The inability to disprove something can't be used as evidence to support its existence. I believe there's far more to the universe than what we can see or understand, and I believe it's totally possible that it was all created by a sentient force. I even think praying is great as long as it doesn't make you feel content with doing nothing. I just can't get behind these religions that claim to know everything while making no attempt to support it with anything provable or observable. Faith is the absence of logic; to have faith is to believe something unbelievable.\n",

      "Aside from the common reasons, the way veganism is spreaded by vegans does not help.  Veganism is treated like a religion and vegans behave as if they are saints, and your question just further perpetuates this ideology. Additionally, veganism is heavily tied to the organic industry, and together they are often seen spreading misinformation and false science to get people to join. In the long run, it probably hurts the cause more than it helps\n",

So the class starts naming things like deer and opossum, rabbits, ect. Keep in mind he is African American. Then a students blurts out coon burger, she also is African American and immediately realizes what she said and seems shocked but also laughing . Some of the class understand the racial implication but the teacher immediately turns around and looks for the student who said it. Its a lecture hall so he was having a hard time finding the student but some students start laughing as the student who said it and she is exclaiming sorry and what not. Then he understands it was just a mistake and him and some other students are laughing. But by far one of the more bizarre/funny moments at occ for me.\n",

      "The American Civil War, widely known in the United States as simply the Civil War as well as other sectional names, was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 to determine the survival of the Union or independence for the Confederacy. Among the 34 states in January 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy, often simply called the South, grew to include eleven states, and although they claimed thirteen states and additional western territories, the Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by a foreign country. The states that remained loyal and did not declare secession were known as the Union or the North. The war had its origin in the fractious issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. After four years of combat, which left over 600,000 Union and Confederate soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed and slavery was abolished. Then began the Reconstruction and the processes of restoring national unity and guaranteeing civil rights to the freed slaves.\n",
      "In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, supported banning slavery in all the U.S. territories, something the Southern states viewed as a violation of their constitutional rights and as being part of a plan to eventually abolish slavery. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a majority of the electoral votes, and Lincoln was elected the first Republican president, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven slave states with cotton-based economies formed the Confederacy. The first six to secede had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 48.8% for the six. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. Efforts at compromise failed, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on \"King Cotton\" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.\n",
      "Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for every state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The first bloodshed of the Civil War occurred in Maryland during the Baltimore riot of 1861 on April 19. Lincoln soon controlled the border states, after arresting state legislators and suspending habeas corpus, ignoring the ruling of the Supreme Court's Chief Justice that such suspension was unconstitutional, and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland  ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a war goal.\n",
      "Causes of secession  \n",
      "The causes of the Civil War were complex and have been controversial since the war began. James C. Bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated by historical revisionists, who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war. Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s. The Republican Party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, Lincoln, won the 1860 election. After Lincoln had won without carrying a single Southern state, many Southern whites felt that disunion had become their only option, because they thought that they were losing representation, which would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.\n",

He just fiddled around on his phone or whatever. Everyone else got along really well. One day while everyone else was out running errands I went to our usual spot where we hung out and it was just him. And I asked where everyone was and he said they were busy, and then I said oh that's cool just tell them we should all hang out later and then he starts getting really flirty and creepy and I was like ehhh back off, dude. And then he started getting angry and saying that I liked some other dude in the group and that I'd never give him a chance and I was like what the fuck man it's platonic I don't date friends. And then he starts calling me a bitch, slut and whore and all so I'm about to leave and then I notice his cousin was hiding behind a pillar with a bat and so I tried to run but they both chased me and eventually caught me right in front of everyone in broad daylight and then dragged me to an alley and beat me and raped me (this is all a dream btw, I'm perfectly fine!).

I think to trade successfully, you have to study what this guy is saying. I'm not saying you should listen to his advice--99.99% of it is bad. But you should learn from it and look beyond graphs and trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of his posts, he says that he can trade successfully with a graph alone. In another, older post, he states that \"past success is not indicative of future success\" or something to that effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Look at the microwave, lasers, phones, smartphones, televisions, computers, the printing press, salt trading to paper cash, etc. You'll see that behind most great inventions, there was someone saying \"this won't work!\", \"people will get bored of it!\", \"it'll sell well for six months only!\" or in the case of books (my favourite), \"our slaves will use it to kill us!\" and shortly after the market boomed.**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Phones themselves might not be an investment but the stocks associated with them were. If you'd have asked -any- financial adviser at the time, \"should I invest in XYZ cellular network stocks?\", they'd say \"NO it's too risky\", because the graphs can only show what just happened. If a 12 year old kid had spoken to you about them the kid would say \"YES WE LOVE THEM! We're all playing snake!\" I'd trust in the kid more and I'd bet my life savings based on that kids information. Why? Because he'd see the real world as it was happening. In this example, I was that kid. I told my parents to invest thousands and thousands into it (at 12 years old, I wasn't old enough to trade myself.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another crucial point MagicPoopCannon makes that you can learn from (basically any piece of advice he has is awesome, just go the reverse of it) is that \"HODLers are dumb! They're not real traders!\" Asides from the obvious, where was this \"real\" trader a few months ago, why can he only predict bearish markets in a bearish market, and why can't he predict stocks that're in a more bullish market? This mentality that you shouldn't \"HODL\" Bitcoin and Litecoin is stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin and Litecoin are both limited in quantity, they are finite. In other words, if everyone held onto their coins but more people wanted them, the price would increase exponentially. As more people want in, the more the price goes up. 10 trillion dollars (an easy figure for the world to put into a cryptocurrency) divide by 55 million (the current amount of Litecoin in circulation) = $181818.181818 per coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less than 0.2% of the world's population have invested in cryptocurrencies, so one sale is a massive proportion to all sales (compared to other markets.) Compare that with 25%+ who have a smartphone... His argument suggesting people short incites instability and this can cause a market crash (you only have to look at the news and FUD to see this.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, if you want to be selfish, you don't have patience and you want £10 in your hand now instead of £1 million in your hand later on, then sure shorting might be viable but the HODLers didn't get rich through shorting. If they all decided to short, you wouldn't hear of multi billionaires being made so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That my friend is why when you hear someone say \"I wish I bought Bitcoin early! I'd be so rich!\" You should respond with, \"**No, you'd have panic sold.**\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, another thing to consider is that every claim he makes has the potential of being a self fulfilling prophecy. A lot of people follow him. If he says it's going to dip in value at point X, 1183466 VIEWS would suggest a fair few people might set a sell right before point X.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words everyone should do a few things:\n",

      "**Understand that the majority always hate technology and new things.**\n",

      "**Those that don't learn from history are condemned to repeat it.**\n",

      "When I noticed it, the more it began to essentially ruin star wars for me as well as other scifi that did this. Rodians are natural hunters because Greedo was a bounty hunter. Trandoshans are slavers and natural hunters because Bossk was a bounty hunter. Mandalorians are a proud warrior people who are natural hunters because Boba Fett was a bounty hunter. Zabraks are proud warriors and natural hunters because Darth Maul was a sith. Hutts are culturally cruel and often seek fortune in illegal organizations because Jabba was a crime boss. Sullustans are natural pilots because Nien Nunb(Lando's co-pilot) was a pilot. Twileks love the arts but are enslaved by the hutts because you see them as dancers in Jabba's palace. Wookies are natural technicians and have a cultural life debt to people who save their lives, because Chewbacca is Han's sidekick who fixes the Falcon. I could go on. I know that some of you don't think this is a big deal which I can understand. Hell it's not even unique to star wars either as lots of scifi suffers this trope but to me it's just lazy and unoriginal writing that breaks my immersion. \n",

      "He drove up blaring loud music, the officers were using a bullhorn to tell him and other traffic to move along. An officer could have gone over and spoken with the man, or given him a ticket for a disturbance of the peace after he exited his vehicle. Obstruction of justice is a bit far. It is possible he could be detained from that perspective and given a ticket. Handcuffing in this situation is a possible violation of his miranda rights and an escalation into arrest. Quite a jump if the man wasn't going to comply. In the end he showed no issues complying, which isn't a surprise given that he could have been seen as provoking hem. It is just as possible that his intent was provoking the officers into arresting him (which would still have been incorrect for the officer's to immediately arrest him). That will be up to witness statements and the accounts from both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same thing will end up being determining factors on whether this was an arrest or detainment. He was handcuffed. He was brought into custody. But was this arrest? Probably. That is what seems to be the general consensus among the media anyways. Take it with a grain of salt, but he was at the very least taken into custody and detained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was the intent to provoke? That isn't able to be determined from the video itself due to the conversations being muffled or outright unknown. However, it is pretty stupid to heckle officers in the middle of a raid. A tense situation, and yelling back at officers. Not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owner could have been smarter (roll up windows, secure the dog better, ect), but regardless this was an unintelligent action on the arresting officers' parts given it was all preventable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the officers were possibly intent on arresting him I doubt they would have allowed him to roll up his windows, let alone enter his vehicle. He could have feared for his own safety, and given the racial trends with cops currently and over-extension of power this is certainly possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even worse, it was a high profile situation where the arrest was made with bystanders recording everything. The officers should have double checked to make sure the dog given it's breed was secured, and the arrest was made far too quickly when matters should have been discussed with the individual on a one-on-one basis to minimize media fallout (especially given how it was an extremely fast reading of the miranda rights if the charges aren't a misdemeanor and he was interrogated on the spot, which isn't likely either way; an interrogation wouldn't serve the officers at this point if the arrest was made for impeding an investigation, vehicle violation, or other charges). \n",
      "\n",
      "He didn't have any posturing that would normally be considered extreme, nor did the animal at first until the owner was arrested (which could be easily considered harassment).\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer motioned towards the dog, and regardless of intent, initiated the dog's attempt to defend a pack member. The officer was incorrect in doing so. It is possible the officers did not know how to properly deal with a loose dog given this part.\n",
      "\n",
      "*The officer was within his right to discharge the weapon and defend himself. That isn't going to be argued. The animal did indeed attack the officer.* It is self-defense, pure and simple. The case is that all of this was preventable, possibly by both sides. Also, what level of self-defense is needed in a situation like this. The officer *was* defending himself and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "California state law is super-ceded in this case by the Supreme Court's ruling from 2012. The man had a right to be where he was given that it was beyond the officer's cars and the area wasn't properly cordoned off. A verbal warning should have been given to back off if the officer's felt it was needed. Again this will be found out in witness statements with the impending investigation on the horizon.\n",
      "If he was directed to do so and disobeyed, then the officers are correct in arresting him. But not if it was because he was filming. That's a dead horse that has been beaten into the ground, even if officers still forget or ignore the ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of what the man said to the officers it is easily thrown out in court, the excuse of impeding an investigation is a relatively moot point given that the area wasn't even properly cordoned off. If the officers required that loud music or disturbances were removed further then the traffic-way should have been blocked off and bystanders removed from the area. Why was it only half a block in area and no officers, just vehicles used to cordon the area? Especially for an armed robbery? It probably should have been a larger area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that the officer discharged a weapon against a potential threat with a large amount of bystanders nearby is what should scare people. A ricochet or complete penetration could have occurred in this instance with a great risk to innocent bystanders (not even the man who was arrested) when alternative methods could have been utilized. Officer's are too quick to rely on their guns instead of their brains sometimes. Justifiably so in many cases, but not more so here.\n",
      "\n",
      "And given that this is turning into a media uproar the whole department will likely have major restructuring in the future.\n",

Just more proof the Republican party has gone bat shit crazy. This has angered me to the core. Not many of you know that I was raised to be an ultra conservative republican and was disowned by my grandfather when I told him I wanted nothing to do that party. Sounds familiar? That attitude of if you aren't with us you're against us and un-American. The attitude of religion belongs in the political theater to protect their outdated views. I remember vividly how violent his reaction was. Very similar to every republican candidate running today. And this court clerk. She broken the damn law. I give two shits about her religious views. Why? Because religion should be a private choice. Because this country was in part founded to escape religious persecution. Because we have SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE!! Many seem to have forgotten that fact. The idea that this poor excuse of a human is likened to MLK or Rosa Parks is a direct assault against the black community. As well as the escapade we saw yesterday. These same asshat republican just a year before said \"just obey the law and you won't get in trouble\" now they celebrate a white person who has done just that. So I have this to say if you support this woman or any republican candidate you are part of the problem. Now I'm not saying the democrats have it right.

He articulated it, quite helpfully, as a failure to distinguish between laws and facts. To say an apple hit Newton’s nose, Chesterton noted, is to say that Newton’s nose was hit by an apple. That is an inviolable law because the one cannot logically occur without the other. “But,” Chesterton continues, “we can quite well conceive the apple not falling on his nose; we can fancy it flying ardently through the air to hit some other nose of which it had a more definite dislike.” \n",

We must answer that it is magic. It is not a “law” for we do not understand its general formula. It is not a necessity, for though we can count on it happening, we have no right to say that it must always happen. A tree grows fruit because it is a magic tree. The sun shines because it is bewitched.\n",

      "I certainly hope that her stance on gun control is an example of her pandering to her base. The notion that gun manufacturers are liable for damages in gun violence is ludicrous. When someone intentionally runs people over, does anyone sue Chrysler Corporation? http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-venice-boardwalk-trial-20150501-story.html I can tell you right now, that if the law were to apply in one case and somehow get passed the Supreme Court, the unintended consequences would be devastating for business. Next thing you know, auto manufacturers are paying out damages for the 40,000 drunk driving deaths a year because they absolutely have the technology to prevent them. We already install it on people's cars after a DUI. In relation to the cost of a car, this would be an easy way to save tens of thousands of lives. In fact, it has been brought up as a potential new regulation several times and shot down because of lobbyists for the auto industry and the fact that drinking and driving is a bipartisan pass time whereas gun ownership has decidedly Republican support. \n",

I will breathe a heavy sigh of relief if she comes to her senses and realizes that the 2nd amendment as clarified by DC V Heller is part of the Bill of Rights that this country is founded on. Since the expiration of the so called \"assault weapons\" ban, violent crime has only dropped year after year. Semiautomatic rifles only account for a fraction of violent crime incidents in the US. There is no rational reason to ban them and banning them only affects people who obey the law. In a world of free trade, you cannot prevent people from accessing rifles. Gun control laws didn't prevent Hans Brievek from killing over 90 people with a banned weapon in Norway or stop AK47s from getting into the hands of the Paris attackers. \n",
